<h1>A VALIANT IGNORANCE</h1>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> was not generally known among his
acquaintances that Marston Loring had come
back from Africa accompanied by a new
friend; this new friend was not introduced
by Loring at either of his clubs, and yet the
two met at least once every day. He was a
man named Alfred Ramsay; a small, insignificant-looking
man, with sandy hair, which
had turned&mdash;in streaks&mdash;the peculiar grey
which such hair assumes, and small, dull
eyes that never seemed to move in his head.</p>

<p>It was nearly three o’clock on the afternoon
following that on which Loring had
called on Mrs. Romayne, and he and his
new friend were together in his chambers
in the Temple. Mr. Ramsay had been there
several times before, and he was sitting now
in an arm-chair in the sunshine with an air<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">{2}</a></span>
of total want of interest in his surroundings,
which was characteristic of him. Loring
was walking up and down the room thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Romayne!” observed Ramsay. “Not
a particularly good name on the market! It
belonged to a first-class swindler twenty years
ago&mdash;William Romayne. This young gentleman
is no connexion, I suppose?”</p>

<p>The remark broke a short silence, and
Loring stopped in his walk and leant back
against the mantelpiece as he answered.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said tersely, “he’s his son.
He has never been in his father’s line, though&mdash;I
doubt whether he knows anything about
him, though it’s an odd thing that he
shouldn’t! As to the name, why, it’s an old
story, and won’t affect any one nowadays,
I take it. The point is that he has this
respectable capital, and is&mdash;exceedingly keen
on increasing it.”</p>

<p>There was a dryness in Loring’s voice as
he said the last words, which implied a great
deal more than did his words. And it was
apparently to that significance that the other
man replied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">{3}</a></span></p>

<p>“A chip of the old block,” said Ramsay
musingly. “I wonder, now, how far it goes?”</p>

<p>The last words were spoken very slowly,
and the dull eyes looked straight before them.</p>

<p>Loring looked down at him with a cynical
smile just touching his lips. He knew considerably
more about his new friend’s character
than he would have chosen to put into
words, and he could guess, not inaccurately,
what was passing in his mind at the moment.
And the realisation of the shadowy possibilities
with which Ramsay was occupied was no
part of Marston Loring’s designs. He made
no direct answer.</p>

<p>“He should be here by this time,” he said
carelessly.</p>

<p>And as he spoke there was a sharp, cheery
rap at the door; it opened quickly, and
Julian Romayne appeared, very boyish, very
good-looking, and with a curious, veiled
keenness in his eyes.</p>

<p>“We were just expecting you,” said
Loring, greeting him with a friendly nod.
“Let me introduce you to Mr. Alfred Ramsay.”</p>

<p>Mr. Alfred Ramsay had risen to honour
the introduction, turning his whole head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">{4}</a></span>
slowly round as he looked at Julian, so that
his eyes still gazed straight before them as
they rested on the young man’s face.</p>

<p>“Pleased to know you,” he said indifferently.</p>

<p>“Very glad to make your acquaintance,”
responded Julian pleasantly. “I hope I’m
not behind time?”</p>

<p>“Pretty fair,” said Loring, laying his
hand on the young man’s shoulder with
kindly patronage. “But Ramsay is a busy
man, you know, so suppose we get to business
at once. Ramsay,” he continued, in a brisk,
businesslike voice, as the three sat down
about the table, “Romayne knows nothing
of the affair whatever. I shall begin by
running over the preliminaries with him.
And, first of all,” he went on, turning to
Julian, “of course it is understood, Romayne,
that we keep the matter to ourselves.”</p>

<p>He spoke in a curt, off-hand manner,
and as Julian made a quick gesture of
acquiescence, he went on in the same businesslike
tone.</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether you know anything
about the Welcome Diamond Mining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">{5}</a></span>
Company?” he said. “Probably not. It
was floated about this time last year, and
the greater part of the business came into
my hands. The shares were taken up all
right, but&mdash;well, it didn’t come to anything,
and its affairs had something to do with
my going out to the Cape. It was in connection
with those same affairs that I and
Ramsay met.”</p>

<p>Julian had listened so far with a clouded
countenance, and now, as Loring paused, he
leant back in his chair with a movement of
irrepressible disappointment.</p>

<p>“Oh!” he said shortly. “It’s a mine,
then?”</p>

<p>“There is a mine in connection with it,”
replied Loring imperturbably. “But you
need not trouble yourself about the mine.
That is only the figure-head, you understand.
The affair itself is a matter of&mdash;arrangement.
Look here, Romayne,” he went on, as Julian
leant suddenly forward across the table,
“shares in the Welcome Diamond Mining
Company are at this moment worth about five
shillings each.”</p>

<p>He paused. He had been leaning carelessly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">{6}</a></span>
back in his chair, and now he moved, uncrossing
his legs, and leaning one arm on the
table.</p>

<p>“In a few days,” he went on deliberately
and significantly, “they will fall to two
shillings.” He paused again, with a slight,
matter-of-course gesture. “That will be
worked, of course,” he said.</p>

<p>Julian nodded comprehension.</p>

<p>“Yes?” he said.</p>

<p>“At that price,” continued Loring, “all
the shares will be bought up by two or three
men, in consequence of private information
received from the Cape.”</p>

<p>The last words came from Loring slowly
and deliberately, and his eyes met Julian’s
significantly. A quick flash of understanding
passed across Julian’s face, and Loring continued
easily:</p>

<p>“Reports to this effect will get about.
The fact of the presence in London of a
mining engineer from the vicinity of the
Welcome will also get about. Perhaps he
may allow himself to be interviewed, you
know&mdash;nothing definite, of course. The
shares will go up with a run.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">{7}</a></span></p>

<p>He paused, and Julian threw himself back
in his chair, tapping the table meditatively
with one hand. His gaze was fixed upon the
wall just over Loring’s head, and there was a
curious expression on his face which combined
the keen matter-of-fact calculation of the
habitual speculator with a certain unconscious
gleam of hungry excitement which was
eloquent of youth and inexperience. A
minute or two passed, during which Mr.
Ramsay’s eyes rested indifferently on the
young man’s face, and then Julian spoke.
His voice, also, in spite of his evident attempt
at emulation of Loring’s businesslike nonchalance,
was just touched by that youthful
incapacity for holding keen personal interest
in abeyance.</p>

<p>“And the private information received
from the Cape will be supplied&mdash;&mdash;?” he said
interrogatively.</p>

<p>“Will be supplied by Ramsay,” returned
Loring.</p>

<p>The words were spoken with the slightest
possible movement of the eyelids. Julian
made a quick gesture of comprehension, and
there was a moment’s silence. Then Loring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">{8}</a></span>
went on crisply, darting a quick glance at
Julian’s face in its calculating eagerness.</p>

<p>“In a private speculation of this kind, of
course, it is a case of working together and
share and share alike. Now, we propose&mdash;Ramsay
and I, you understand&mdash;to make up
a joint capital for the purchase of these
shares. We are prepared to put into it fifteen
thousand pounds between us, and we want
another ten thousand at least. If you are
prepared to put in that sum, or more, on
the understanding that the profits&mdash;after
each man has received back his original
investment&mdash;are divided into three equal
shares, we are willing to take you in with
us.”</p>

<p>Julian looked up at him quickly.</p>

<p>“Into three equal shares?” he said,
with a stress on the adjective.</p>

<p>“Into three equal shares,” returned
Loring drily. “Capital is not the sole requisite
in this affair, and the other factors are
supplied by Ramsay and myself.”</p>

<p>A dark flush mounted to Julian’s forehead,
and the avidity in his eyes developed.</p>

<p>“It’s a large order, though,” he said. “I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">{9}</a></span>
don’t quite see where I come in at that rate,
after all.”</p>

<p>Loring leant back in his chair and looked
him full in the face.</p>

<p>“You can please yourself, of course,”
he said. “Take it or leave it. You will
come in to the tune of something like thirty
thousand. If you see your way to trebling
your capital by any other means, do so. Lots
of fellows will be glad to take your place
with us.”</p>

<p>Julian’s eyes gleamed greedily, and he
wavered obviously.</p>

<p>“Those are your final terms?” he said.</p>

<p>“Our final terms,” said Loring concisely,
looking at Ramsay, who nodded nonchalantly
in confirmation of the words.</p>

<p>A silence ensued. Julian sat staring down
at the table, his brows knit, evidently in close
thought. At last he glanced up suddenly at
the two men who had been waiting carelessly
for his decision.</p>

<p>“I call it rather rough,” he said brusquely;
“but&mdash;all right. If the thing looks all right
when you’ve trotted it out, I accept.”</p>

<p>He passed on instantly, with a brief, telling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">{10}</a></span>
question, to the inner working of the
scheme.</p>

<p>There is perhaps nothing by which self-revelation
is more frankly and unconsciously
made than through the means by which a man
may be most easily roused to enthusiasm. Enthusiasm&mdash;a
genuine quickening of his mental
pulses, even&mdash;had been a condition of things
practically unknown to the easy-going, commonplace
Julian Romayne of a year before; but
in the course of the last two months he had
experienced it often. To hear of large sums
of money, large profits, rapid returns on
striking investments, touched him, instinctively,
as a record of artistic achievements
will touch an artist, as triumphs of research
will touch an historian, as prodigies of physical
prowess will touch an athlete. And as Loring
answered him now, and went on with fuller
and more technical detail, his face changed
strikingly. His eyes brightened, and an eager,
fascinated light came into them; he leant
farther forward, listening, commenting, questioning,
with quick and always increasing
excitement.</p>

<p>Half an hour passed, and still the three men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">{11}</a></span>
sat about the table, talking in terse, businesslike
fashion; three-quarters of an hour, an
hour. At the end of that time, Julian, his
face flushed and eager, his eyes glistening and
sparkling, his hand absolutely shaking with
excitement, was holding that hand out to
Mr. Ramsay with a gesture which witnessed
to the work of that hour, as volumes could
not have done. As far as words went, he and
Mr. Ramsay had hardly exchanged three
sentences; it was the bond that lay behind
the words that had drawn them together.
Mr. Ramsay had spoken very little, indeed,
but his silent presence had never for a moment
seemed superfluous, or without a certain indefinite
weight; and there was a dull approval
in his slow eyes now as he turned them on the
young man.</p>

<p>“We’ve settled so much, then,” said
Julian, in a quick, familiar way, “and we
meet here on Thursday at two. Until
then&mdash;&mdash;” He turned to Loring, and
stretched out his hand eagerly. “Thanks,
old man,” he said in a low, quick voice.
“Thanks.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">{12}</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Miss</span> Pomeroy’s visit to Mrs. Romayne was
postponed for a fortnight. At one time,
indeed, it seemed not impossible that Mrs.
Pomeroy’s visit to her sister in Devonshire
might be postponed indefinitely, and Mrs.
Romayne was charmingly inconsolable over
her prospective disappointment.</p>

<p>It was a delightful thing to have a girl
in the house! Mrs. Romayne made the
discovery and the statement as the very
first evening of Miss Pomeroy’s stay with
her drew to a close. And certainly, the
evening, signalised by a little dinner-party,
had been pleasant enough to warrant satisfaction.
Julian had been in the best possible
spirits, elated apparently by the presence of
his mother’s visitor, at whose side he was
to be found whenever his duties as host<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">{13}</a></span>
allowed such concentration of his attention.
Miss Pomeroy herself had been a model of
gentle amiability, and had looked more than
usually bright and pretty. Loring, who had
made one of the dinner guests, had also
been at his best and most amusing. No
conversation of any length had, of course, been
possible between him and his hostess; but
a quick, low-toned word or two passed
between them in the movement that ensued
upon the reappearance of the men in the
drawing-room after dinner.</p>

<p>And on the tone of that first evening,
that of the fortnight into which Miss
Pomeroy’s stay lengthened itself was modelled.
They were very dissipated, Mrs. Romayne
asserted laughingly; and she further declared
that she had never enjoyed dissipation so
much. Julian’s hard-working impulses seemed
to be in partial abeyance for the time being;
their demands on him, though peremptory
when they did occur, did not prevent a
great deal of attendance on his mother and
her guest. Loring also seemed hardly to
have settled back into his usual routine,
and frequently made one of the party. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">{14}</a></span>
appearance on the scene, and the recognition
of that compact between them which he
never failed to make, either by a glance or
a few quiet words, were never without a
certain effect on Mrs. Romayne; not on her
spirits, for they never varied in their gaiety;
but on a hard restlessness in her eyes, always
lessened for the moment by that look or
word from Loring.</p>

<p>The last day of June was also the last
day of Mrs. Pomeroy’s absence from London,
and it was, moreover, the day fixed for a
certain dance which was to stand out from
all the other dances of the season. The
givers of this dance were parvenus of the
most pronounced type, and during the past
three seasons, they had paid their way into
London society by spending fortunes on the
entertainments they gave. This season they
had issued cards of invitation, on which
each guest was requested to wear mediæval
Florentine dress, and it had been whispered
abroad that thousands were to be spent in
providing such a setting for these costumes
as should eclipse anything hitherto seen.
Fortunately for the projectors&mdash;and nobody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">{15}</a></span>
knew better than they how absolutely impossible
it was to calculate in such a matter&mdash;the
idea caught society’s fancy; it was
taken up with the wild enthusiasm which
alternates in the modern mind with blank
indifference; and as every one with an
invitation had spent some three weeks in
ardent consideration of his or her dress for
the occasion, that occasion had acquired a
fictitious importance of a colossal nature,
and was absolutely looked forward to as
promising something quite unusual&mdash;and
equally indefinite&mdash;in the way of amusement.</p>

<p>The whole thing had evidently been
arranged, Mrs. Romayne declared gaily, to
give a final touch of triumph to the end
of Maud Pomeroy’s visit to her. It was
about four o’clock in the afternoon of the
day in question, and she and Miss Pomeroy,
with Julian as escort, were taking what she
described as “a little turn” in the Park
when she expressed this opinion. It was
a perfect June afternoon, the Park was very
full, and all three seemed to be exhilarated
either by the sunshine, the movement, or
the prospect of the evening. The fortnight’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">{16}</a></span>
intimate association with her present companions
had apparently had no effect whatever
upon Miss Pomeroy’s demure conventionality
of manner, but her word was readier than
usual, and her expression was brighter; Mrs.
Romayne talked and laughed and kept the
ball of chatter going; and about Julian’s
hilarity there was a touch of excitement
which was a characteristic which had grown
upon him markedly in the course of the last
month. He turned upon his mother, protesting
gaily.</p>

<p>“That’s much too depressing a point
of view,” he said. “It forces on us exactly
what we want to forget&mdash;that it is the end.
Now, I’ve made up my mind to cut the
connection between to-night and both
yesterday and to-morrow, and enjoy myself
tremendously.”</p>

<p>“And is ‘cutting the connection’&mdash;it
sounds as if something might blow up&mdash;an
indispensable preliminary?” laughed Mrs.
Romayne.</p>

<p>“Why, of course.” He glanced at Miss
Pomeroy as he spoke, and the colour deepened
in her cheeks by just a shade as she turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">{17}</a></span>
to Mrs. Romayne and said, with one of
her little smiles and a rather poor attempt
at mock confidence:</p>

<p>“Mr. Romayne wants to forget the
terrific anxiety which he has already suffered
over that gorgeous dress of his, and the
terrific bill from which he has still to
suffer.”</p>

<p>Julian’s protestations were as eager and
boyish in manner as they were delicate and
skilful in matter, and Mrs. Romayne broke
in upon them with a laughing apology and
a request that Julian would tell the coachman
to turn out into Piccadilly and drive
to a house in Grosvenor Place. Julian gave
the order, and added to it:</p>

<p>“You can pull up when you get out of
the Park.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Romayne took up the words instantly.</p>

<p>“Are you not coming with us, bad boy?”
she said. “Come and help us pay one call,
at any rate. We are going straight home
after that to prepare ourselves for the
triumphs of the evening by a little refreshing
laziness, are we not, Maud?”</p>

<p>“I should like to immensely!” returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">{18}</a></span>
Julian ardently as Miss Pomeroy smiled a
response. “But I’m afraid I must go down
to the club. I promised to meet Loring
there! Dinner at eight, I suppose?” he
added as the carriage drew up and he jumped
out.</p>

<p>He stepped back on the pavement, lifting
his hat as the carriage drove off. Then he
jumped into a hansom and gave the word to
drive, not to the club but to the Temple.
Arrived there he ran upstairs, the excitement
about him gaining ground moment by moment,
to Marston Loring’s rooms. Loring was there
alone. He was seated at the writing-table
writing rapidly, his face keen and intent, and
he suspended his work for an instant only as
he glanced up on the opening of the door and
nodded a greeting.</p>

<p>Julian’s life for the last month had been
lived at that high pressure which is only produced
in a man by the consciousness that
he has burnt his ships. Every shilling that
he had accumulated during the previous six
months was invested in the scheme propounded
to him a month ago by Marston
Loring; and the history of his real life during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">{19}</a></span>
the interval would have been a history of
the stages through which that scheme had
passed. The affairs of the Welcome Diamond
Mining Company had followed precisely the
course indicated by Loring during that first
interview on the subject between Loring,
Ramsay, and Julian. Shortly after that interview
“Welcomes” had fallen to a nominal
price; they had then been bought up
according to arrangement. A slight rise
had followed as a matter of course, followed
by an interval of vacillation, and a slow
succession of trifling advances, which had
again been succeeded by a period of quiet.</p>

<p>So far the excitement with which every
hour had been instinct for Julian had been
the excitement of preparation solely; the
ground had been tilled and the seed sown.
And what that soil was in which he had
sown his seed; what were the characteristics
that were to prove so stimulating; it was
not in him to consider. He was perfectly
well aware of the nature of the transaction
in which he was engaged; he had understood
at the outset that the “private information
received from the Cape” on which the shares<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">{20}</a></span>
were to be bought up was a “put up thing,”
as he would have expressed it, between Ramsay
and Marston Loring; and the knowledge
affected him not at all. That black thread
in the warp of his character was running
strong and deep now, and to such considerations
his sensibilities were absolutely
dormant.</p>

<p>“Well?” The monosyllable broke from
him eager and impetuous, as though it contained
the pent-up suspense and excitement
of hours. He had come up rapidly to Loring’s
side, and the latter, without lifting his eyes,
signed to an evening paper which lay on the
table as he said briefly:</p>

<p>“All right!”</p>

<p>Julian’s face turned quite white; he
snatched up the paper and turned with
breathless eagerness to the column devoted
to the money market.</p>

<p>“Welcome Diamond Company Shares.”</p>

<p>The blue eyes seemed to leap at the line
and fasten on it with a hungry avidity pitiful
to see, and he stood there gazing at it with
glittering, fascinated eyes, with a curious
stillness upon him from head to foot, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">{21}</a></span>
though all remembrance of his actual surroundings,
all thought even of Loring, had
faded. Nearly five minutes had passed when
Loring laid down his pen and leant back in
his chair, turning a little that he might fix
his eyes on Julian as he stood rather behind
him.</p>

<p>“Pretty fair?” he said carelessly.</p>

<p>Julian lifted his eyes from the paper and
turned his white face to Loring. He nodded
as though the feelings of the moment were
not to be put into speech, and then the slow,
deep colour of excitement began to creep over
his features.</p>

<p>“Have you seen Ramsay?” he said in a
low, quick voice.</p>

<p>“Saw him this morning. He told me
things were beginning to move. It was that
paragraph yesterday that did it!”</p>

<p>“And what about keeping it up?” said
Julian. “This is the ticklish moment, I take
it! What’s the next move?”</p>

<p>He had thrown himself into a chair as
he spoke; his voice was jerking with eagerness,
as though some of his excitement were
finding expression. Loring looked at him for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">{22}</a></span>
an instant before he answered. He was asking
himself a question which had formulated itself
in his mind more than once in the last month;
namely, was it merely the influence of his
blood which made young Romayne so keen
a speculator; or was there something concealed
in the background of his life which
made money a desperate necessity with
him?</p>

<p>“This is the next move,” he answered,
indicating the sheets of manuscript paper
which lay before him. “This will be in
one or two of the papers to-morrow, and
if I’m not mistaken it will have a big
effect!”</p>

<p>Julian stretched out his hand impulsively
for the sheets and ran through them, now
and then breaking into an eager comment;
and as he finished he rose impetuously and
began to pace excitedly up and down the
room. His face was flushed now, and his eyes
glowing.</p>

<p>“Yes, that ought to take us a long way!”
he said. “And Ramsay backing it up all the
while, of course? Loring, what do you make
of it? An affair of&mdash;weeks?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">{23}</a></span></p>

<p>“An affair of two or three weeks, all
told!” returned Loring nonchalantly. “The
inside of a month ought to put the best part
of thirty thousand into each of our pockets,
my boy.”</p>

<p>He rose as he spoke, and gathered together
the sheets of manuscript, but as he did so
his quick ear caught a strange, sharp catch
in Julian’s breath. He fastened up the papers,
and directed them with another of those slight
smiles, and then turned again to the younger
man. Julian was standing at the window
staring almost stupidly out.</p>

<p>“I’m going to turn you out now!” said
Loring lightly. “Coming down to the club
with me?”</p>

<p>Julian turned round, but the words
seemed to penetrate slowly to his consciousness.</p>

<p>“No!” he said at last. “No, thanks, old
man. I&mdash;I’m going to get home.”</p>

<p>He had to go to his own chambers first,
it appeared, however, and Loring left him
with a careless “All right! See you to-night,
of course!”</p>

<p>The sunshine had left Julian’s room, bright<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">{24}</a></span>
as it still was outside, and it looked, perhaps,
the darker by contrast as he opened the door
and shut himself in alone. He paused a
moment, with his hand on the lock, and then
walked aimlessly across to the writing-table
and sat down. There was a pale, dazed look
about him.</p>

<p>The line in the evening paper at which
he had gazed with such devouring eyes had
chronicled the first important rise of those
shares on which his hopes were staked;
chronicled, in fact, the beginning of the end.
As he sat there alone, the words seemed to
stand out all about him; to meet his eyes
in every direction; and it was little wonder
that, as he realised that the seed so eagerly
sown had indeed broken ground at last, the
perfect fruit seemed to be already in his hand,
and he was dazed and intoxicated with anticipated
triumph. He had the blood of a
speculator and a gambler in his veins, and
as he sprang up suddenly from his chair and
began to pace up and down the room, it was
the surging of the speculator’s instinct that
flushed his face and glittered in his eyes; the
rioting of that money passion which, to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">{25}</a></span>
man who has never felt its fever, is the
strangest and most repulsive&mdash;as it is the
most abnormal&mdash;of all passions.</p>

<p>But little by little, without volition or
even consciousness on his part, the current
of his thoughts changed. Gradually that
greedy, tumultuous contemplation of money
as an end wavered, altered into a contemplation
of money as a means, into a passing over
of that means in the realisation of the end
which it was to bring about. He was thinking
of Clemence, thinking of her in a tumult of
excitement in which the goading of that two-edged
dart of love and shame which quivered
always in his better nature was absolutely
unfelt; thinking of her in a very hallucination
of intoxicated triumph. He was living out
with her a future life of triumphant satisfaction;
a life so utterly incompatible with the
facts of the case, with all that had come and
gone, and must still come and go, as to be
a most pathetic imagining; when the sound
of a clock striking brought him suddenly to
himself.</p>

<p>His first conscious thought was a certain
vague surprise at his surroundings; as far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">{26}</a></span>
as externals went he had left Loring’s room
and had come to his own like a man walking
in his sleep. Then he realised the nature
of the sound that had roused him, and drew
out his watch to see what hour it was that
had struck. It was seven, and the fact, with
the pressing necessity for his return home
which it involved, gave a turn to the current
of his thoughts by which, without changing
their main character, they were blended in
with the actual practicalities of the moment.
He thought of his mother with a certain bitter
triumph. “It’s not for long,” he said to
himself, “not for long now.” His mind ran
on over the details of the evening before him;
the little dinner&mdash;“only ourselves,” Mrs.
Romayne had said gaily; the artificialities
that would pass between himself and his
mother; the effective flirtation which he
would have to keep up with Miss Pomeroy&mdash;the
flirtation which in the excitement of
the past month he had carried on recklessly.
And then with his hand on the
door he stopped abruptly&mdash;stopped and stood
quite still with a strange, defiant recklessness
growing in his face. Whether it was some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">{27}</a></span>
curious effect of the tumult through which
he had passed, whether it originated in those
jubilant visions of Clemence from which he
had so recently awakened, it is not possible
to say. But on that instant there had risen
within him an impulse of fierce, overmastering
repulsion against his mother, against Miss
Pomeroy, against the part he had chosen to
play. Almost before he had realised the
sudden sense of overwhelming revolt and
distaste which had seized him, its obverse was
upon him. Clemence! To see Clemence! To
speak to Clemence! To satisfy the hungry
longing which, for the moment, seemed absolutely
to possess him!</p>

<p>Such a longing, in various forms and
degrees, had shaken and torn him often before,
but hitherto something&mdash;some influence from
Clemence’s own words, some jarring and
throbbing of that better nature in himself&mdash;had
held him back. But now, strung up and
carried out of himself by his excitement, he
was impervious to all considerations save that
of his own overmastering craving. The end was
very near now, he told himself. It was a
question of a week or two only. He must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">{28}</a></span>
see her; she herself would see that it was
only reasonable that he should see her!</p>

<p>His plans were laid in the passing of a
few seconds. The only address Clemence had
given him was that of the house of business
where she worked&mdash;where she had worked
when he met her first&mdash;his only chance
of seeing her lay in meeting her when she
left her work at night. He would not go
home to dinner, he decided; he would telegraph
to his mother, and dine at a quiet
restaurant. That would bring him, as he
knew well enough, to the earliest hour at
which the “hands,” of whom Clemence made
one, were likely to be released, and he would
wait in the little by-street in which the
“hands’” entrance was situated until she
came.</p>

<p>He went out of the room with a quick,
assured step, sent off his telegram&mdash;a brief
“Detained. Inconsolable”&mdash;from an office
in Fleet Street, and then, carefully avoiding
the fashionable resorts, he walked to the
restaurant he had mentally selected.</p>

<p>The little street which, for some scores of
men and women, formed the picture evoked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">{29}</a></span>
by a name which, for the shopping population
of London, involved a mental vision of a
busy thoroughfare and a considerable expanse
of plate-glass windows, ran parallel to that
thoroughfare, divided from it only by a long
block of buildings; and bearing in mind the
slight nature of the division between the
two, the contrast presented was almost
startling. The little street was a thoroughfare
inasmuch as it led from one side-street
to another; but these streets were very little
frequented, and the connecting-link between
them was a short cut to nowhere. It represented
simply so many back entrances to
places of business, and these being to a great
extent monopolised by a single firm, the
comings and goings at stated times of the
hands employed by that firm was often the
only movement that broke the quiet from
morning until night. In the intervals between
these comings and goings there brooded
over the street such a silence and stillness
as seemed strangely incompatible with the
thought of all the labour and effort that it
held; with the hard day’s work towards
which those coming footsteps in the morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">{30}</a></span>
were bent; with the hard day’s work which
lay behind those departing footsteps in the
evening. The street itself had a squalid,
neglected look, too, as though life and activity
had passed it by.</p>

<p>The day’s work was not over yet, though
the evening light was making long shadows,
and the setting sun was turning the upper
windows of the opposite houses into ruddy
fire; the street was absolutely silent and
deserted when Julian turned quickly into it.
He pulled up and surveyed his surroundings
with a rapid, comprehensive glance.</p>

<p>It was too early yet. He looked at his
watch and told himself so with somewhat
over-elaborated carelessness, and took out
his cigarette-case. He lighted a cigarette;
and pacing slowly up and down the pavement
on the opposite side of the street to
that on which he expected Clemence to
emerge, he began to reckon with himself the
chances for and against her speedy or tardy
appearance.</p>

<p>But such practical, matter-of-fact considerations
involved a deliberate mental action
on his part, and having gone through it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">{31}</a></span>
urged by that curious instinct under which
intense excitement always desires to assert
itself as absolute calm and sanity, he gradually
let himself slip away again from the practical
and the actual, and gave himself up to the
tide of his exhilarated imaginings.</p>

<p>There is nothing more exciting, nothing
that sooner quickens the mental pulses into
a very fever of confusion, than the sudden
indulgence of an impulse long resisted. The
hour that had passed since the idea, of which
his presence in that quiet little street was
the outcome, had flashed into Julian’s mind
and dominated it, had carried him as completely
out of himself, and out of touch
with realities, as is a man under the influence
of absinthe. As a man so exhilarated will
be impervious to a considerable amount of
physical pain, so Julian was for the time
being absolutely unconscious of anything
painful or shameful in his position. The
circumstances under which he had parted
from Clemence; all the bitter pain and
longing under which he had smarted and
writhed with such fierce rebellion; the attitude
towards himself which his conduct might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">{32}</a></span>
only too justly have created in his wife;
were absolutely obliterated from his mind.
He was waiting now&mdash;husband, master,
altogether the superior; triumphant, successful,
self-assured&mdash;for his mistaken but doubtless
submissive wife; conscious, and rather
pleased with the consciousness, that he loved
her in spite of her faults.</p>

<p>One quarter after another chimed out
from a neighbouring clock. He had been
waiting nearly an hour, oblivious, in his
elation, of tedium or weariness; oblivious
of the claim upon him of the life of Queen
Anne Street as though it had no existence
for him. The slight feeling of impatience
with which he realised that the fourth
quarter was chiming was entirely unconnected
with such externals; and it was an eloquent
testimony to his mental attitude that it took
the form of a faint sense of irritation with
Clemence for delaying so long. A vague
feeling of lordly disapproval of her conduct
stirred in him, as he paused at the top of
the street and glanced across at the still
fast-closed doors. He was just looking
dubiously at his cigarette-case when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">{33}</a></span>
click of a latch, instantly followed by the
sound of girls’ voices, made him start
violently. He thrust the case hastily into
his pocket and walked quickly down the
street, until he was standing just opposite
the door from which a little stream of girls
and women was pouring forth.</p>

<p>Several figures had already detached
themselves from the stream and were
moving rapidly away, either singly or in
pairs; but one quick glance told him that
neither of these was Clemence, and he fixed
his eyes with eager confidence on the doorway
through which she had still to pass.
His face was flushed with intense excitement.
On came the stream, girls and women following
one another in unbroken succession;
pretty girls, plain girls, shabby girls, smart
girls, some arm in arm, some laughing and
talking in loud-voiced groups; several of
these groups noticed his waiting figure and
commented upon it in giggling whispers,
turning back as they passed down the street
to look at it again, but Julian only saw
that none of these was Clemence. The
stream was beginning to dwindle; stragglers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">{34}</a></span>
followed one another now at irregular intervals;
the two girls who had been the
last to appear had nearly reached the end
of the street, and still Julian’s eyes were
riveted on the open doorway.</p>

<p>The girls turned the corner, and down
the dim passage into which he was looking
there came slowly another figure quite
alone. Before it had emerged into the light
Julian was across the road, as though that
one great throb with which his heart leapt
up to meet her had impelled him physically,
and as Clemence passed out into the soft
dusk of the June evening he spoke her
name, eagerly at first, then with a strange
break in his voice:</p>

<p>“Clemence! Clemence!”</p>

<p>At the first sound of his voice&mdash;evidently
the first sign to her that he was near&mdash;a
low, indescribable cry broke from Clemence;
she turned towards him trembling, swaying
as she stood, and Julian caught her in his
arms lest she should fall.</p>

<p>“You’ve come!” she cried, and before
the exquisite rapture and relief of her faint,
quivering voice, with all that it implied of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">{35}</a></span>
suffering past, a harder man than Julian
might have melted. “My dear, my dear,
I knew you’d come! I knew! I knew!”</p>

<p>But that pathetic voice had not been
needed. The first sight of her face as she
turned it upon him with that wonderful
irradiation of joy upon it, had shrivelled
into nothingness all the exultation, all the
triumph and self-satisfaction of the past few
hours, and Julian held her in his arms, his
trance over, self-convicted, self-condemned;
his whole consciousness absorbed in that
heavy, throbbing agony of his better nature
which had leapt into sudden relentless
life. What it was that so penetrated him
he could not have defined. Where and
in what proportion old influence revived,
touched, and was blended with a heart-piercing
sense of the change in her, he
could not have said; he did not even know
that these were indeed the powers that had
struck him. The change in her, even as
he gazed down at her face with agonised,
remorseful eyes, as it rested for one moment
on his shoulder, he rather felt than traced
and understood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">{36}</a></span></p>

<p>That change was very great. Those
past six months had dealt heavily with
that thin, white face, and the marks of
their passing were plain to see, even in
that moment of absolute transfiguration.
Every curve, every suggestion of girlishness
seemed to have been worn away; worn
away by those cruel twin refiners, never
so pitiless as when they work together&mdash;physical
suffering and mental distress. The
outline of her features had lost some of
its beauty in that intense accentuation;
the colourless lips were slightly drawn, and
under the sunken eyes were heavy shadows.
But no remembrance of the physical loveliness
which she had lost could stand for an
instant before the spiritual loveliness which
she had gained. It was as though those
twin refiners, before whom nothing earthly
or external can stand and flourish, had
strengthened that which lay behind the
externals with which they had dealt so
ruthlessly. The eyes, so indescribably beautiful
as they looked now into Julian’s, had
been beautiful even in that moment before
she realised his presence; beautiful in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">{37}</a></span>
heaviness as no brightness, as no common
happiness could have made them; beautiful
with the perfect patience and dignity of
accepted suffering. The tired mouth had
been beautiful in its repose, as it was
beautiful now in its tremulous rapture;
beautiful in its quiet constancy and self-abnegation.</p>

<p>She let herself rest for a moment in his
arms; clinging to him with something in
her touch which he had never felt before;
looking up into his face as her head lay
back against his shoulder with a strange,
tremulous, tender light quivering on every
feature, shaken from head to foot by little
tremulous, tearless sobs&mdash;the sobs of utter
relief and peace. Then she disengaged herself
gently, and drew herself away, something
of that first ecstasy dying out of her face
to leave it soft and happy beyond all words.
That strange light still shone in her eyes,
and, as she moved, one thin hand retained
its clinging hold on his arm, as though
some instinct of dependence influenced her
involuntarily. She was dressed, not as the
other girls had been, in a light summer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">{38}</a></span>
jacket, but in a long cloak, and as she
drew it about her with the other hand, the
softest touch of colour came into her white
cheek.</p>

<p>“My dear!” she said softly. “My
dear!”</p>

<p>And Julian whispered hoarsely as he had
whispered again and again:</p>

<p>“Clemmie! Clemmie!”</p>

<p>He made no attempt to take her in his
arms again. Even the gesture with which
he laid his hand upon those clinging fingers
on his sleeve was diffident and almost
tremulous; tender and reverent as no gesture
of his had ever been in all his life before.
He could find no words. In her presence
everything&mdash;all the triumph, all that had
seemed to him the necessities and realities
of life&mdash;seemed to have fallen away from him.
He was nothing. He had nothing! He
could say nothing to her.</p>

<p>There was a silence; silence which for
Clemence as her fingers closed round his,
and that soft colour came and went in her
cheeks, breathed an ineffable content; silence
which for Julian held the blackest depths<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">{39}</a></span>
of self-revelation and self-contempt. It was
broken at last by Clemence.</p>

<p>“Is it done, dear?” she said gently.</p>

<p>Julian’s hand turned cold in hers, and his
eyes fell away from her face.</p>

<p>“Not&mdash;not yet, Clemmie!” he faltered
wretchedly. “I&mdash;I came to tell you&mdash;to tell
you that&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That you are going to do it? That
you are going to do it? My dear, my dear,
you mean that? Oh, you mean that, don’t
you?”</p>

<p>She had not raised her voice or changed
her pose, but that touch upon his arm had
become a close, convulsive grip, and even
the clutch of the worn, blanched hand
upon her cloak witnessed to the agony of
supplication with which every nerve was
strained and quivering. Her low voice
thrilled and vibrated with it; her white
face, to which his first words had brought
a look of heart-sick disappointment, was an
embodied prayer. He could not answer on
the instant; it cut him like a lash; and
she went on rapidly, her low, beseeching
voice breaking and trembling with the intense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">{40}</a></span>
feeling that flickered on her face like
a light.</p>

<p>“Julian, for my sake, for your wife’s
sake, dear! I love you so! I&mdash;I need you
so! Don’t part us any longer! If it was
for your good, if it was to make you happy,
there’s nothing I would not face, and face
cheerfully&mdash;ah, you know that, don’t you?
But you’re doing wrong, and I think of it
always, and it makes the loneliness so that
I can’t bear it. Oh, I can’t bear it!”</p>

<p>She broke suddenly into low shuddering
sobs and tears, and her head fell forward
helplessly on to his breast, though she still
kept her convulsive hold upon his arm.
He put his other arm round her and drew
her towards him, and as he did so he seemed
to realise with a kind of double consciousness
the course he would take and its utter
contemptibility.</p>

<p>“Don’t, Clemmie dear! Don’t! don’t!”
he said in a broken, uneven voice. “It’s
all right, dear! I’m going to do it! I came
to tell you so! It’s all right!”</p>

<p>“You’re going to&mdash;tell her?”</p>

<p>“I am, Clemence! I promise you I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">{41}</a></span>
am! Only&mdash;only not for a week or two.
There’s&mdash;there’s something I must wait
for!”</p>

<p>“But you are going to? You are?
You are?”</p>

<p>“On my&mdash;on my soul, yes, Clemence!”</p>

<p>There was a moment’s silence, broken
only by her low, tremulous sobs; then these
too died away. At last, with a long sighing
breath, she raised herself and looked into
his pale, miserable face, with her own quiet
and exhausted.</p>

<p>“Must you wait?” she said, with an indescribable
accent on the first bitter word.
“Must you?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I must, dear!” he said desperately,
his eyes trying wretchedly to avoid hers.
“It shan’t be long, I promise you; but I
must wait just a little longer!”</p>

<p>She paused a moment, still looking into
his face. Then, with a sudden light in
her eyes, she made a slight movement
as though she would have bent his head
down that she might murmur in his ear.
She stopped herself, however, and there
settled down upon her face a look of unutterable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">{42}</a></span>
sadness. By Julian, in his helpless
misery of self-contempt, the gesture had
passed utterly unheeded.</p>

<p>“Don’t let it be much longer, dear!”
she said. “Good night!”</p>

<p>Julian caught at the last word as though
it gave him some sort of chance of restoring
his writhing self-respect.</p>

<p>“Good night!” he echoed. “Not yet,
Clemence! I’m going to see you home, of
course!”</p>

<p>But Clemence shook her head.</p>

<p>“No!” she said steadfastly, “no, dear!”
Something in her tone, something in the
touch she laid upon him, took from him
all power of self-assertion, all power of
resistance to her will. She drew his head
towards her now, kissed him softly on the
forehead, and then turned and went away
down the street, leaving him alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">{43}</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">“Romayne,</span> at last! By Jove, old man,
we thought you were going to throw us
over!”</p>

<p>The voice, a young man’s voice, struck
out, as it were, from an indescribable medley
of incongruous sound. The background was
formed by the lightest and most melodious
dance music, produced solely from stringed
instruments; lutes and guitars seemed to
predominate, and the result had a character
and rhythm of its own which was essentially
graceful, picturesque, and Italian; against the
background, a high-pitched discord compounded
of every imaginable key, there
clashed a very Babel of tongues&mdash;the eminently
unmusical voice of modern society, with all
its faults of modulation and pronunciation,
blended into a whole full of a character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">{44}</a></span>
absolutely incompatible with the old-time
southern harmonies with which it mingled.</p>

<p>The speaker’s figure, as he stopped suddenly
in a hurried passage across the room,
stood out from a blaze of colour, light, and
gorgeousness of every description, which fell
without pause or cessation into ever fresh
combination, as the beautifully dressed crowd
moved to and fro in its magnificent setting.
And the spectacle presented to the eye was
as curiously jarring, as strikingly suggestive
of the ludicrous inconsistencies of dreamland,
as were the sounds that saluted the ear.
There was hardly a man or woman to be seen
whose dress was not as faithful a copy of the
costume prevalent among the Florentine
nobles under the magnificent rule of the
Medici as time and money could make it.
There was not a false note in the surroundings;
money had been poured out like water in
order that a perfect reproduction of an old
Florentine palace might be achieved; and as
far as art could go nothing was left to be
desired. The fault lay with nature. The
old Italians doubtless had their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">{45}</a></span>
mannerisms, possibly their own vulgarities,
of carriage, gesture, and general demeanour;
but theirs were not the mannerisms and
vulgarities of modern “smart” society.</p>

<p>The young man who had greeted Julian
exemplified in his own person all the preposterous
incongruity of the whole. His dress
was a marvel of correctness to the minutest
detail. Its wearer’s face was of the heavy,
inanimate, bull-dog type; his movement as he
shook hands with Julian was an exaggerated
specimen of the approved affectation of the
moment; his speech was clipped and drawled
after the most approved model among
“mashers.” He was the son of the house,
and there was a kind of slow excitement
about his manner, struggling with a nonchalant
carelessness which he evidently
wished to present to the world as his mental
attitude of the moment. There was a note of
excitement also in the medley of voices about
him. The “affair” was “a huge go”&mdash;as the
young man himself would have expressed it.
And neither he nor any one of his father’s
guests was troubled for one instant by any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">{46}</a></span>
sense of the ludicrousness of the effect
produced.</p>

<p>Julian had that instant entered the room
and had paused on the threshold. There is
perhaps no type of costume more picturesque
in its magnificence than that of the Italian
noble of the Middle Ages&mdash;this is perhaps the
reason why it has been so extensively vulgarised&mdash;and
Julian’s dress was an admirable
specimen of its kind, rich, graceful, and
becoming. There was a subtle difference between
his bearing and that of his host, though
Julian’s demeanour, too, was modern to the
finest shade. He wore the dress well, with
none of the other man’s awkwardness, but on
the contrary with an absolute ease and unconsciousness
which implied a certain excited
tension of nerve. His face was colourless and
very hard; but upon the hardness there was
a mask of animation and gaiety which was
all-sufficient for the present occasion.</p>

<p>“I’m awfully sorry, dear boy!” he said
now, lightly and eagerly, and with an
exaggerated gesture of deprecation. “It’s
horribly late, I know! Give you my word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">{47}</a></span>
I couldn’t help it! By Jove, what a magnificent
thing you’ve made of this!”</p>

<p>The other glanced round with a satisfaction
which he tried in vain to repress.</p>

<p>“Not so bad, is it?” he said carelessly.
“Only these fellows are such fools, even the
best of them; they always blunder if they
can.” With this wholesale condemnation of
the workmen among whom, some fifty years
ago, his grandfather might have been found,
he screwed his eyeglass into his eye, serenely
unconscious of the comic effect produced, for
the better contemplation of a pretty girl at
the farther end of the room. “Lady Pamela
looks awfully fit, doesn’t she?” he observed
parenthetically; continuing almost in the
same breath: “The gardens are the best part,
seems to me. Awfully like the real thing,
don’t you know!”</p>

<p>Julian’s only direct answer was an expressive
gesture of appreciation and apology.</p>

<p>“Awfully well done!” he said. “Excuse
me, dear boy, I see my mother, and she’ll
want to know why I’ve not turned up before.
I must go and explain.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">{48}</a></span></p>

<p>His companion laughed; the laugh was
rather derisive, and the glance he cast on
Julian through his eyeglass was stupidly
inquisitive and incredulous.</p>

<p>“What a fellow you are, Romayne!” he
said. “They ought to put you in a glass case
and label you the model son.”</p>

<p>Another gay, expressive gesture from
Julian.</p>

<p>“Why not?” he said lightly. “We’re a
model pair, you know.”</p>

<p>And the next moment he was threading
his way quickly across the room. A sudden
movement of the crowd had shown him his
mother’s figure, and he had realised instinctively
that she had seen him. He came
up to her with a manner about which there was
something indescribably reckless, and made
her a low bow of gay and abject apology.</p>

<p>“I beg ten thousand million pardons!”
he said. “Language fails to express my
feelings.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Romayne’s dress was not a success&mdash;that
is to say, it was perfect in itself, and
failed only as a setting for its wearer; to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">{49}</a></span>
deprive her appearance of any possibility of
“chic” or “dash” was to deprive it of all
its brilliancy. But no unsuitability of
colouring or cut in her gown could have been
responsible for the look which underlay her
smile, as she turned to Julian now and
struck a little attitude of mock implacability,
with a light, high-pitched laugh.</p>

<p>“Then the conversation must be carried
on in dumb show,” she said, “for language
also fails to express my feelings, sir. What
have you to say for yourself?”</p>

<p>Her voice, for all its gaiety, was thin and
strained.</p>

<p>“Please, nothing,” was the mock-humility
answer. “I met a fellow, and he beguiled
me. He was just off to America.”</p>

<p>He was standing with his hands folded
and his eyes cast down, and he did not see&mdash;he
would not have understood if he had seen&mdash;the
strange flash in those hard, blue eyes&mdash;such
a flash as might leap up in the eyes
of a woman in the silent endurance of a swift
stab of pain.</p>

<p>“A very poor excuse,” declared Mrs.
Romayne gaily. “No, I don’t think I shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">{50}</a></span>
forgive you yet. Such unscrupulous desertion
must be visited as it deserves. Don’t you
think so?”</p>

<p>Lord Garstin had come up to them, and
the question was addressed to him with a
light laugh as she gave him her hand. He
nodded pleasantly to Julian as he answered:</p>

<p>“Who has deserted? Not this boy of
yours, eh?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Romayne laughed again, and pushed
Julian playfully with her fan.</p>

<p>“Oh, I forgot! You don’t know his
wickedness, of course! Take me away from
him, Lord Garstin, do, and I’ll confide in
you. Gorgeous affair this, isn’t it? I wonder
what it cost?”</p>

<p>Lord Garstin looked round with a rather
lofty smile. There were times when it
pleased him to pose as an isolated representative
of a bygone age by the traditions of
which, in matters of taste and breeding, the
present age was utterly condemned.</p>

<p>“Rather too gorgeous to please an old
man,” he said now with a fine reserve.
“These dear good people would be more to
my taste, do you know, if they had a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">{51}</a></span>
less money. Have you been outside, by-the-bye?
It’s really not badly done.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Romayne turned away with him,
laughing and nodding to Julian, and then
she stopped and went towards her son again,
touching his shoulder lightly.</p>

<p>“Every one isn’t so stony-hearted as I
am, bad boy,” she whispered gaily. “Somebody
has actually kept you some dances, I
believe, if you apologise properly. Look,
there she is.”</p>

<p>She made a little gesture with her fan
towards the entrance to the dancing-room,
from which Maud Pomeroy was just emerging,
looking like a picture in a white dress of
the simplest form, her long hair loose
on her shoulders, and crowned with a
wreath of flowers. The dance music had
stopped, and the music which still filled
the air came from the garden. With that
hard recklessness growing stronger on his
face, Julian made a slight, graceful gesture
towards his mother as though he would
have kissed his hand to her in gratitude,
turned away, and moved rapidly over to Miss
Pomeroy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">{52}</a></span></p>

<p>More than three hours had gone by since
Julian had found himself standing alone
gazing stupidly in the direction in which
Clemence had disappeared, and how the first
two of those hours had passed he hardly
knew. He had turned abruptly away and
left the little street, to walk mechanically on
and on, struggling blindly in a black abyss
of self-contempt, in which his love lived only
as additional torture.</p>

<p>He had emerged gradually from that abyss,
or rather his sense of its surrounding blackness
had faded by degrees, as all such acute
sensations must. And so completely had that
blackness walled him in, and deadened all
his outward perceptions, that it was only
little by little, and with a dull sense of surprise,
that his material surroundings dawned
on him again, and he realised that he was
standing looking down into the river from
the Thames Embankment. His consciousness
had come back to that life and world which
he believed to constitute the only practical
realities; but it had brought with it that
which turned all its environment to bitterness
and gall. As he stood leaning on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">{53}</a></span>
parapet, staring sullenly down, counting the
reflection of the lamps in the dark water
beneath him in the moody vacancy of reaction,
the necessities of his life began to surround
him once more; he saw them all as they
were, sordid and base, and yet he neither
saw nor attempted to see any possibility of
self-extrication. The sound of Big Ben as
it struck eleven had brought back to his
mind the claims upon him of that particular
evening.</p>

<p>At eleven o’clock the carriage had been
ordered to take Mrs. Romayne and her party
to the dance, and a grim, cynical smile
touched his set, white lips as he thought
of his mother. He had broken loose, temporarily,
he told himself bitterly. He must
take up his part again and play the farce
out.</p>

<p>That he should throw himself into the
task with a wild oblivion of all proportion
and limitation, was the inevitable result of
all that had gone before; of all the perception
and all the blindness with which he
was racked and baffled.</p>

<p>Miss Pomeroy saw him coming, and turning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">{54}</a></span>
her face away, she produced a pretty, well-turned
comment on the arrangement of the
rooms for the benefit of her cavalier. The
next instant Julian stood beside her.</p>

<p>“Don’t turn your back on me,” he implored
gaily. “No fellow ever had such hard
luck as I’ve had to-night. Be a great deal
kinder to me than I seem to deserve, and
forgive me. Please!”</p>

<p>Miss Pomeroy turned her head and looked
at him with a serene calm on her pretty
face, which seemed to relegate him to a
place among inferior objects entirely indifferent
to her. Her voice was perhaps a little too
indifferent.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Romayne!” she said. “You’ve
actually appeared!”</p>

<p>“I have,” he said. “At last! There’s a
poor fellow I’ve seen a good deal of&mdash;not
one of the regular set, you know, but a
thoroughly unlucky chap, always in the wars.
He’s just off to try his luck on the other side
of the world, and I met him this evening
most awfully blue and lonely&mdash;he hasn’t a
friend in the world. Of course I had to try
and cheer him up a bit, and&mdash;there, I couldn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">{55}</a></span>
leave him, don’t you know. I packed him
into the mail train at last, and bolted here
as fast as wheels could bring me.”</p>

<p>Something of the blank serenity of Miss
Pomeroy’s face gave way. She lifted the
feather fan that hung at her girdle and began
to ruffle the feathers lightly against her other
hand with lowered eyelids.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I should have troubled
to hurry as it was so late!” she said, and
there was a touch of reproach and resentment
in her voice. Her cavalier had drifted away
by this time, and in the midst of the constantly
moving stream of people she and
Julian were practically alone. Julian answered
her quickly with eager significance.</p>

<p>“You would&mdash;in my place!” he said.
“You would if you had had the hope of
even one of the dances to which you had
been looking forward&mdash;well, I won’t say how,
or for how long. Was it altogether a vain
hope? Am I quite too late?”</p>

<p>“You are very late!” was the answer;
but the tone was distant and indifferent no
longer; and as the sound of the violins
rose softly and invitingly once more from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">{56}</a></span>
the other room a quick question from Julian
received a soft affirmative in reply, and he
led her triumphantly towards the music.</p>

<p>The room was not too full. The garden,
the supper, the “show”&mdash;as the guests called
it amongst themselves&mdash;as a whole, prevented
any overcrowding in the dancing-room.
But dancing among such cunningly arranged
accessories was by no means a commonplace
business. The unfamiliar picturesqueness of
the room, with its softly scented air, the
wonderful effects of colour and light, and
above all a certain wild passion and sweetness
about the music, was not wholly without
effect even on the jaded, torpid receptivity
of men and women of the world.</p>

<p>Even Miss Pomeroy’s calm was apparently
not wholly proof against the intoxication;
by the time the music died away there was
a bright colour on her cheeks, and a bright
light in her eyes. On Julian the atmosphere
and the music had had much the same effect
as an excessive quantity of champagne might
have had. His pale face had flushed hotly,
and his eyes were glittering with excitement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">{57}</a></span></p>

<p>He had become aware during their last
turn round the room that his mother was
standing in the doorway watching them, this
time with Loring in attendance; and with
a feverish flash of callous defiance he so
guided their movements that they came to
a standstill finally close before her.</p>

<p>“Congratulate us!” he cried gaily, “we’ve
broken the record! And congratulate me
individually, for I’ve had the most awfully
glorious dance of my life! Hullo, Loring,
old man!”</p>

<p>“I’ll congratulate you both,” was Mrs.
Romayne’s ready answer, as Loring nodded.
“You both look as if you had had a good
time. Wonderful show, isn’t it? It isn’t
possible to say what it must have cost.
Something appalling, of course. Maud, dear,
have you come across Claudia Eden? Over
there, don’t you see? Isn’t it outrageous?”</p>

<p>“By Jove!” ejaculated Julian lightly,
looking in the direction indicated by a slight
movement of his mother’s fan, as Miss
Pomeroy uttered an exclamation of pretty
amazement. Conspicuous against all the
magnificence about her was a girl in a kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">{58}</a></span>
of burlesque of an Italian contadina dress of
the period, with very short skirts, very low-cut
bodice, very exaggerated head-dress. She
was talking and laughing with a little crowd
of men; her manner was as pronounced and
as unrefined as her dress; but there was
about her that absolutely unconscious and
impenetrable self-possession and self-assurance
which stamped her as being by birth that
which she was certainly not in appearance&mdash;a
lady, and a very highly born lady.</p>

<p>“She would do anything to make a
sensation,” murmured Miss Pomeroy, contemplating
her critically.</p>

<p>“But have you two seen the gardens?”
went on Mrs. Romayne gaily. “No? Then
you must simply go instantly. The most
marvellous thing I ever saw! Go along at
once.”</p>

<p>With a laugh Julian turned to Miss
Pomeroy. “We must do as we are bidden,
of course,” he said. “Will it bore you
frightfully?”</p>

<p>A smile and the slightest possible shrug
of the shoulders constituted Miss Pomeroy’s
answer, and they were turning away together,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">{59}</a></span>
followed by a keen glance from Loring, when
the girl in the contadina dress, passing close
to them with her somewhat noisy court,
intercepted their passing.</p>

<p>“‘Evening, Maud,” she said in a loud,
good-natured voice, which might have been
delicate and high-bred if fashion had not
demanded other characteristics. “Hullo,
Mr. Romayne! Like my frock, Maud?”</p>

<p>Miss Pomeroy murmured something gracefully
inaudible, and Mrs. Romayne said, with
a smile:</p>

<p>“Most original, Lady Claudia.”</p>

<p>A restless gleam had come into Mrs.
Romayne’s eyes at the momentary pause,
but there was a certain satisfaction, too, in
her smile as the two girls stood face to face.
Maud Pomeroy certainly never appeared to
greater advantage than in contrast with a
pronounced type of the modern society girl.
The juxtaposition seemed to bring into strong
relief everything about her appearance and
demeanour which was dainty, gentle, and
sweet, and to throw into shade all her more
negative charm. Her voice, now, perfectly
modulated and absolutely even, made the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">{60}</a></span>
other girl seem “quite too vulgar,” as Mrs.
Romayne said to herself. She echoed Mrs.
Romayne’s words, and added:</p>

<p>“How came you to think of it?”</p>

<p>“I thought it would score,” returned the
other, with a laugh. “I can’t stand these
people, don’t you know! I thought of
getting a whole lot of us to do it; it would
have been no end of a joke! Then I thought
that I’d keep it to myself. Ta-ta!”</p>

<p>And with a rough, ungraceful gesture of
farewell she passed on.</p>

<p>“Lady Claudia’s hostess would strangle
her, cheerfully, with her own hands,” remarked
Loring placidly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Romayne laughed.</p>

<p>“So would a great many other people,”
she said. “But come, you two be off and
see these gardens.”</p>

<p>Julian and Miss Pomeroy moved away
as if with one consent, and Mrs. Romayne
watched them as they went with such a
strange intentness in her face, that she
looked for the moment as though her
consciousness were actually leaving her to
follow the two on whom her eyes were fixed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">{61}</a></span></p>

<p>The idea of the whole entertainment had
originated, so people said, in the fact that
its giver had spent enormous sums of money
in the course of the past three years on the
transformation of his grounds into an Italian
garden, and the scene from the terrace, as
Julian and Miss Pomeroy stepped out on to
it, was indeed extraordinarily effective. There
was no moon, and thousands of coloured
lamps, skilfully disposed, shed a picturesque,
uncertain light, under which the long ilex-shaded
alleys, the box hedges, the fountains,
and the statues produced an illusion which
was almost perfect.</p>

<p>“By Jove!” exclaimed Julian in the
same strained, excited voice. “Capital, isn’t
it? It must be almost worth while to live
away here in the wilds of Fulham to have
a place capable of being turned into a show
like this. Don’t you think so?”</p>

<p>Miss Pomeroy did not answer immediately.
Apparently, the excitement created
by their dance had rather strengthened than
diminished during the interval, and she was
playing almost nervously with her fan. Miss
Pomeroy was not a nervous person as a rule.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">{62}</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t know,” she said vaguely. “Yes,
it’s very pretty, isn’t it? But I don’t
think I should much care to have a big
place, do you know. I don’t think places
make much difference.”</p>

<p>Her voice was low, and very prettily
modulated, and Julian threw a quick sideways
glance at her. Except for a flush, and
a certain look in her eyes which he could
not see, her face was as demure and placid
as ever.</p>

<p>“Don’t you?” he said. “You are right,
of course, and I am wrong. I can imagine
circumstances under which all this would be
a howling wilderness to me.”</p>

<p>He looked at her very differently this
time, with his eyes recklessly eloquent. She
dropped her own eyes quickly, and said
softly:</p>

<p>“Can you?”</p>

<p>They had strolled down the steps as
they talked, and at their right hand a
picturesque little alley, with a vista of
fountain and statue against a grove of ilex-trees,
led away from the more open space
in front of the house. Down this alley,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">{63}</a></span>
secluded and apparently deserted, Miss
Pomeroy turned, as if unconsciously, before
she spoke again. Julian followed her lead
with an ugly smile on his face.</p>

<p>Then she said in the same pretty, low
voice:</p>

<p>“Tell me what circumstances?”</p>

<p>Julian laughed, and his laugh might well
have been construed as a sign of extreme
nervousness and agitation.</p>

<p>“I think not!” he said. “I might make
you angry.”</p>

<p>“You would not make me angry!”</p>

<p>They came to the end of the alley as she
spoke; it opened out on a quaint little
corner containing a fish-pond surrounded by
a stone balustrade, the fountain in the middle
sparkling and dancing in the gleam of the
artificial moonlight which had been arranged
here and there about the grounds to give
the finishing touch to sundry “bits.” Into
this moonlight Maud Pomeroy stepped, and
stood leaning gracefully over the balustrade
gazing down into the water, as she said in
a voice just low and hesitating enough to
be perfectly distinct:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">{64}</a></span></p>

<p>“Mr. Romayne, will you tell me&mdash;did
you think me very angry when you came
to-night?”</p>

<p>“I hope you are not angry now, at
least!” was the answer, spoken with eager
anxiety. “But I would rather think you
had been angry than believe that you were
quite indifferent as to whether I came or
not!”</p>

<p>“I am not&mdash;indifferent!” Maud
Pomeroy paused. There was no colour at
all in her cheeks now, and her lips were
drawn together in a hard, thin line such as
no one had ever seen on her face before.
There was a dead silence. A sudden
stillness had come over Julian’s figure as he
stood also leaning against the balustrade,
but with his back to the water. His hand
was clenched fiercely against the stone.</p>

<p>“I have no right to be angry with you,”
Maud Pomeroy went on; her voice was thin
and hard as if its steadiness was the result
of deliberate effort. “I have no rights at
all. If I had&mdash;&mdash;” She let her voice die
away again with deliberate intention.</p>

<p>The silence that followed had something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">{65}</a></span>
ghastly in it. At last, with his face as
white as death, and keeping his eyes fixed
steadily before him, Julian moved.</p>

<p>“You will catch cold, I’m afraid!” he
said, a little hoarsely. “Shall we go in?”</p>

<p>Without a single word Miss Pomeroy
moved also and retraced her steps up the
alley. For one moment, and for one moment
only, her face was no longer that of a gentle
and amiable girl, but of a spiteful and
vindictive woman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">{66}</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">More</span> than one of the people who had talked
to Mrs. Romayne in the interval had been
vaguely aware of a certain incontrollable preoccupation
behind her manner; though the
intense, suppressed excitement in which that
preoccupation originated passed undetected.
Her restless eyes fastened upon Miss Pomeroy
and Julian on the very instant of their
reappearance in the room, and as they came
towards her that excitement leapt up suddenly
and lit up her whole face with a wild flash of
hope and anticipation. They drew nearer and
it died down again even more suddenly than
it had sprung up; and in its passing it seemed
to have aged her face curiously, and to have
left upon it a stamp of heart-sick disappointment,
touched with a creeping anxiety.
Miss Pomeroy was pale, and her usual still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">{67}</a></span>
placidity seemed to be accentuated into
absolute stupidity. Julian’s face was quite
colourless, and beneath the travesty of his
usual manner which he assumed in speaking
to his mother, there was an indefinable expression
which made him look ten years older
and twenty years harder and more bitter.</p>

<p>Scruples on his part as to crushing their
dress prevented his going home with them.
He would follow in a hansom, he said. But
before he arrived Miss Pomeroy had said good
night to Mrs. Romayne with a neatly-turned
and quite meaningless expression of the
pleasure the evening had given her, and had
retired to her room. Mrs. Romayne, looking
haggard and worn, lingered until Julian came
in, and went out to meet him.</p>

<p>“Good night, mother,” he said, and went
straight upstairs without pausing.</p>

<p>It was many, many years since he had
left her at night without a kiss; and as Mrs.
Romayne went slowly up to her room through
the silent house, she stumbled once or twice
as though her wide, dry eyes hardly saw the
stairs before her.</p>

<p>That creeping anxiety had gained ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">{68}</a></span>
greatly in her face the next morning when she
came down at about half-past ten, to learn from
the servant that “Mr. Julian” had already
breakfasted and had gone to the Temple. Even
more pathetic than the anxiety itself was the
courage that battled against it; that strove so
hard to become confidence as she led&mdash;and,
indeed, sustained&mdash;the conversation, as she
and Miss Pomeroy, who was late in putting in
an appearance, breakfasted together. She
talked lightly and gaily of Julian’s defection
on this, their visitor’s last morning; she
deplored the fact that it was indeed the last
morning, talking of various half-formed
schemes for such constant meetings as
would be practically a continuance of the
intimate association of the past fortnight.
But of response she obtained little or none.
An access of conventionality, demureness, and
insipidity seemed to be inspiring Miss Pomeroy;
an access characterised by a certain absolute
obstinacy of colourlessness. She had no
opinions, no sentiments of any sort or kind to
offer; her expressions of regret at leaving were
as unmeaning as they were correct. Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">{69}</a></span>
Romayne’s plans seemed to wither under her
little non-committal smile and comment; and
she took her irreproachable leave an hour
later with a vaguely expressed hope that they
might meet “somewhere,” and apparently
without hearing Mrs. Romayne’s parting
allusion to Julian.</p>

<p>Each one of the days that followed seemed
to leave upon Mrs. Romayne’s face some such
effect as might have been produced upon a
marble counterpart of that face by the delicate
application of a sharp modelling tool. Every
feature became a little sharper; every line a
little deeper, a little harder. Nobody noticed
the fact, and nobody could have traced it to its
source had they done so. But there were
times when she was alone; times when that
chisel under which she grew more haggard
every day revealed itself as heart-sick, gnawing
anxiety.</p>

<p>For three or four days Miss Pomeroy’s hope
that they might meet “somewhere” remained
unfulfilled; and Mrs. Romayne made little
jokes at what she assumed to be Julian’s disconsolate
condition; jokes which, taken in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">{70}</a></span>
conjunction with the look in her eyes as she
spoke them, were almost ghastly. Then the
meeting took place at a party from which, as
it appeared, Miss Pomeroy and her mother
were just departing; so that a few words
of greeting on either side was all that
passed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pomeroy and her daughter called on
Mrs. Romayne a day or two later. It was
Mrs. Romayne’s “day,” of course; the room
was very full, and as Mrs. Pomeroy said, with
an expression as near apprehension as was compatible
with her placidity in the eyes which
kept turning to her daughter’s demure face:
“Wednesday is such a popular day, and
we’ve really dozens of calls to pay, haven’t
we, Maud?” Consequently they stayed
barely ten minutes, and exchanged half-a-dozen
sentences with their hostess. But short
and formal as the call was, it was supplemented
by no more intimate intercourse.
They met, of course, nearly every day. That
is to say, Mrs. Romayne, as she went about
indefatigably from party to party, caught
constant glimpses of Miss Pomeroy and her
mother just arriving as she left, just leaving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">{71}</a></span>
as she arrived, just going to supper, to tea, to
fulfil some social duty or other which made it
impossible that more than a word or two
should pass. When Mrs. Romayne pressed
Miss Pomeroy, with sprightly reproaches, to
come and see her, she was met invariably with
unmeaning smiles, and vague words about
engagements, which, gentle as they sounded,
proved as little capable of manipulation as a
stone. Once or twice after such a meeting,
Mrs. Romayne’s jokes at Julian’s expense, as
she told him of them airily afterwards&mdash;Julian
and Miss Pomeroy never seemed to
meet now&mdash;took the form of hints and innuendoes
as to whether he was not at the
bottom of “the mystery,” as she called it;
and whether he could not perhaps sweep it
away. There was a terrible contrast between
the casual gaiety with which such hints
were dropped by her, and the something
which lay behind; something which gave her
voice a strange, unnatural ring, and cut her
words off almost before they had any meaning;
something the name of which, as it lurked in
the hard, bright eyes which never met Julian’s,
was nervous fear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">{72}</a></span></p>

<p>Such hints were always met and turned
by Julian as lightly as they were uttered.</p>

<p>Before a fortnight had passed since Miss
Pomeroy’s departure, Mrs. Romayne had
acquired a habit of giving one quick, almost
furtive, glance round any room she entered in
which people were assembled, and that look
was particularly eager and intent as she
entered a drawing-room to fulfil an engagement
for a luncheon-party one day at the
beginning of the third week. A luncheon is
by no means a bad opportunity for a “quiet
chat.” She did not see the figures she was
in search of, though no one could have
detected that fact from her expression. Nor
could any one have interpreted the sudden
exclamation of surprise she uttered.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s Dennis Falconer!” she said
prettily. “I had no idea you were in town.”</p>

<p>It was Dennis Falconer; not a little
altered by the past eight months, and altered
for the better. Six months earlier he had
disappeared from the ken of his society
acquaintances; disappeared quietly, almost
imperceptibly. By-and-by, when his absence
began to be commented upon, rumour had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">{73}</a></span>
whispered it abroad that he was “laid up or
something.” The fact, so lightly stated and
equally lightly commented on, had meant
for Falconer a realisation of the possibilities
hinted at by his doctor early in November.
He had passed from the dreariness of unoccupied
and somewhat lonely club life into
the infinitely heavier dreariness of a solitary
sick-room.</p>

<p>Within his own limits and on his own
lines Dennis Falconer was a strong man.
With his dark hour absolutely upon him
he braced himself to meet it with stern
dignity; and he endured four months of
physical suffering and mental tedium&mdash;from
which that suffering, weary and unremitting
as it was, was seldom acute enough
to relieve him&mdash;with uncomplaining fortitude.
He was quite alone. Circumstances had
occurred to detain Dr. Aston in India, and
his solitude was not realised by any of his
club acquaintances. It was a period on which,
in after life, he never willingly looked back;
a dark hour, in truth. But it was lived
through at last, and as it passed away it gave
place to a clear and steady light, in which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">{74}</a></span>
shadows which had preceded it had vanished.
Severe as had been the means, the end was
amply attained. He emerged from his sick-room
in such perfect physical health as he had
not known for years. All the disabilities
under which he had laboured during the
preceding summer were removed, and in every
nerve and muscle he was conscious of vigorous
life. In May he had received his doctor’s
permission to return to his work, and he was
in London now to arrange the preliminaries
of an expedition with which he hoped to leave
England early in the autumn.</p>

<p>The physical change in him was conspicuous
as he stepped forward to return Mrs. Romayne’s
greeting. He looked ten years
younger than he had been wont to look; the
worn look of endurance had gone, and there
was an air of strength and power about him
which was very noticeable. Hardly less
striking was the change in his expression.
Much of the grim austerity of his demeanour
during the previous summer had originated
in the painful depression consequent on his
state of health; much also in his realisation of
his position as a man laid aside and solacing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">{75}</a></span>
himself as best he might. The gravity and
reserve of his expression remained, but the
heaviness had disappeared completely.</p>

<p>His manner to Mrs. Romayne, as he shook
the hand she held out to him, was significant
of the lighter and more tolerant point of view
from which his own lighter prospects unconsciously
led him to contemplate his fellow-creatures.
It was neither expansive nor
friendly, but it lacked that undercurrent of
stiff condemnation which had previously characterised
it.</p>

<p>“I have intended to call on you,” he said
with grave directness. “I am sorry to appear
negligent. But my time is no longer at my
own disposal.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Romayne put aside the claim on his
time which he imputed to her with a quick
gesture and a laugh.</p>

<p>“You are quite recovered, I hope?” she
said easily. “Tiresome business, convalescence,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I am quite recovered, I am thankful to
say,” responded Falconer; he was so keenly
conscious of all that the words meant for him
that he was insensible even to the jarring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">{76}</a></span>
effect her manner had always had for
him. “I hope before very long to be at
work again. Indeed, I am practically at work
now.”</p>

<p>“Yes?” said Mrs. Romayne prettily.
“Are you thinking of going abroad again?”</p>

<p>“I am going out to Africa. I shall
hardly be in England again for another five
years.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Romayne had been looking vaguely
about the room, evidently bestowing a
modicum of her attention only on Falconer.
But as he spoke the last words the slightest
possible start passed through her frame
and her wandering eyes suddenly ceased
to wander. There was a moment’s pause,
and then she turned them on Falconer’s
face.</p>

<p>“Really? And when do you go?”</p>

<p>There was something rather odd beneath
the carelessness of her voice, and her eyes,
as she fixed them on Falconer’s, were odd
too.</p>

<p>“I hope to leave England early in
October.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Romayne made no reply. Her face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">{77}</a></span>
suggested curiously that the actual exigencies
of the situation had faded for her, that she
was not in the present at all. For the moment
there was no trace of that satisfaction and
relief which would have been the natural
consummation, on such news, of the defiance
and distaste so hardly repressed in her manner
to her “connexion” during the past year.
She looked, apparently unconsciously, into the
grave, steady man’s face above her, and
there was a vague, half-formed expression
in her eyes, which might have been a
suddenly-stirred sense of loneliness or foreboding.</p>

<p>It was gone again in an instant. And as
the man who was to take her in to lunch
approached her, she turned from Falconer
with the lightest possible “au revoir.”</p>

<p>Falconer found himself very well situated
at luncheon. A question came up on which
his word carried weight, and the discussion
which ensued brought home to him that sense
of renewed power and standing in the world
so grateful to him after his long period of
inaction. He was full of grave content and
satisfaction, when, after lunch, circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">{78}</a></span>
threw him again with Mrs. Romayne; and
his whole mental attitude was suffused with a
dignified kindliness. He began to speak at
once with grave, but not unfriendly interest,
and as though he were conscious of a certain
remissness.</p>

<p>“I am glad to hear of your son! I hope
it is quite satisfactory to you?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Romayne had acknowledged his
vicinity with a conventional word and smile.
Circumstances demanded of her at the moment
no active exertion; she was standing aside, as
it were, for the instant, and there were tired
lines faintly visible about her mouth. They
disappeared, however, as if by magic, beneath
the hard intentness which leapt into her face
as she turned sharply to Falconer on his first
words. The movement was apparently involuntary,
for she turned away, lifting with
elaborate carelessness the long eye-glasses
which she had lately adopted, as though to
cover the first movement, and said, as she
looked through them at something at the other
end of the room:</p>

<p>“It’s very stupid of me, no doubt, but I
must ask you to explain!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">{79}</a></span></p>

<p>The neutrality of her previous conversation
with him had vanished as completely as
the strange suggestion with which it had ended
had vanished. The old defiance, apparently
entirely uncalled-for, rang in her elaborately
indifferent voice.</p>

<p>“Is it so old a story?” said Falconer.
“Or is it, perhaps, a mistake?” he added
with genuine regret. “I hope not. A sensible
marriage is such a safeguard&mdash;a covenant with
society. I heard of your son’s engagement
some three weeks ago on what purported to be
excellent authority.”</p>

<p>“Did you hear the name of the young
lady by any chance?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Romayne achieved a harsh little laugh
as she spoke.</p>

<p>Falconer glanced round the room and
lowered his voice.</p>

<p>“Miss Maud Pomeroy!” he said. “A
most desirable wife for him, I should have
said!”</p>

<p>Eight months before, under the inexplicable
influence of the face and manner of the
pale, dignified woman who had faced him so
bravely in the little lodging in Camden Town,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">{80}</a></span>
Dennis Falconer had been almost ready to
urge upon Julian Romayne marriage with the
girl he was supposed to have ruined. But he
would have done so convinced, in the recesses
of his heart to which that woman’s influence
could not penetrate, that such a course must
mean ruin to the young man; and in the grim
severity of his mental attitude at the time,
he would have said that such ruin was the
just and righteous consequence of the young
man’s guilt. Clemence’s disappearance had
frustrated the possibility of any such action
on his part; time and the pressing actualities
of his own life had obliterated the impression
made on him; and the whole affair had
gradually faded into the past. Insensibly to
himself he looked upon it now, conventionally
enough, as one of those dark episodes which
are in no way to be obliterated or lightened,
but which may and must be overlaid. To
that end it seemed to him, in the relaxation
of his sterner attitude, a thing so natural
as to be necessarily condoned that Julian
should marry in his own class and settle
down.</p>

<p>A moment’s pause followed on his words.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">{81}</a></span>
Mrs. Romayne was sweeping the room with
her eye-glasses. The hand which held them
shook a little, and, if the man beside
her could have known it, she saw absolutely
nothing.</p>

<p>“Maud Pomeroy!” she said at last, and
she seemed to be unconscious of that moment’s
interval of silence. “Ah! Well, to tell you
the truth, that is not such an extraordinary
report, though it hardly represents the fact&mdash;at
present. Young people will be young
people, you know, and they must be allowed
their little wilfulnesses!”</p>

<p>She also had lowered her voice, though
it was high-pitched, and her speech was
almost exaggeratedly confidential. Influenced
by the tone into which they had thus fallen,
Falconer said, meaningly and not unkindly:</p>

<p>“You have had to make no more serious
allowances, I hope&mdash;since?”</p>

<p>With a laugh so light and high as to be
painfully out of tune, Mrs. Romayne answered
him gaily in the negative. One little peccadillo,
she said, was not such a very terrible
thing in a young man’s record, and she was
charmed to say that with that little affair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">{82}</a></span>
of which they both knew her anxieties on
Julian’s account had begun and ended. She
held out her hand to Falconer as she finished
her assurance, parting with him with her
brightest air of society friendliness, and as
he wished her good-bye, looking down into
the trivial vivacity of her face, Falconer felt
himself stirred for the first time by a certain
touch of pity for her. Coming upon his
softer mood and the comparatively friendly
nature of their talk, the eager assurance with
which she spoke struck him as being not
without pathos. He had no confidence in
Julian, and it occurred to him vaguely and
with a sense of surprise that if the security
so superficially founded should prove false,
the blow would be somewhat disproportionate
to the lightness of the nature on which it
must fall. The next instant he recollected
how largely her own actions would have
contributed to bring about the blow, and
he dismissed her sternly from his thoughts
as she passed out of the room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Romayne went straight home, though
she had numerous calls on her list for the
afternoon; her eyes were even desperately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">{83}</a></span>
bright and defiant; and that same evening
Marston Loring received a note asking him
to come and see her on the following day.</p>

<p>He found her waiting for him in the
drawing-room at the hour she had appointed,
and she plunged into the matter in hand with
an affectation of spontaneous confidence which
was most effective.</p>

<p>She had sent for him in his capacity of
fellow-conspirator, she told him; she was in
a little perplexity and she was turning to
him, as usual&mdash;this with a charming smile&mdash;to
help her. From this prelude she went
on to speak of the strange change which had
come about in the relations between herself
and Julian on the one hand, and the Pomeroys
on the other. Loring’s keen eyes had detected
this change some time since&mdash;by this time,
indeed, it was being whispered about somewhat
freely&mdash;but he only listened with grave
attention. The upshot of her speech was: did
Loring know anything about it? Had Julian
said anything? Had he spoken of any
quarrel, of any misunderstanding? Had his
friend any kind of clue to give her as to his
feelings on the subject?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">{84}</a></span></p>

<p>The ease and gaiety of her manner, which
strove to give to the whole thing something
the air of a joke, was disturbed and broken
as she came to the point by a feverishness
about which there was nothing gay or light.
And some uncertainty as to how far she had
gone seemed to pervade her mind and to produce
a feeling that some kind of explanation
was necessary.</p>

<p>“You see,” she said, “it isn’t always safe
to go to the fountain-head in these little
matters! A young man doesn’t always care
to be questioned by his mother! One might
‘give offence,’ you know!” Her tone was
playful, but her eyes were filled with the
nervous fear which lurked in them so often
when she and Julian were alone together, and
the look on her face as she spoke her last
words seemed to give to that fear a definite
object. It was the fear of “giving offence”
to her son.</p>

<p>Loring put the explanation aside with a
smile, but he had no words of enlightenment
for her. Julian, he said, had preserved a
total silence on the subject.</p>

<p>“I will see what I can do,” he said finally,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">{85}</a></span>
with a smile that cancelled the offensiveness
of the intention conveyed of “pumping” his
friend. “And we will confer further. Meanwhile,
I know you will like to hear that his
financial proceedings are prospering exceedingly,
and are discretion itself!”</p>

<p>But the further conference, which took
place in a day or two, was entirely fruitless
as far as its nominal purpose was concerned.
Loring did not reveal to Mrs. Romayne the
exceeding brevity and decision with which
Julian had dealt with any and every attempt
to lead the conversation towards the Pomeroys,
but he gave her to understand that at
present he had nothing to tell her.</p>

<p>One night, about a week later, when she
and her son came home in the dawn of the
July day from a series of “at homes,” Mrs.
Romayne, instead of saying good night to
Julian at the door of her room, as was her
custom, laid her hand suddenly on his arm
and drew him just across the threshold. Her
face was white to the very lips, and there
was a set desperation in it stronger even than
the fear with which her eyes were full. Her
voice, as she spoke, was breathless and uncertain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">{86}</a></span>
as though her heart beat with painful
rapidity.</p>

<p>“Julian,” she said, “what is it that has
gone wrong between you and Maud Pomeroy?”</p>

<p>A flash, so quick in the passing that its
intense bitterness was not to be detected,
passed across Julian’s face; it seemed to leave
him armed with an expression of determined
brightness which defied all emotion or sentiment.</p>

<p>“I don’t know that anything has ‘gone
wrong,’ dear,” he said lightly.</p>

<p>His mother’s hold on his arm tightened
desperately.</p>

<p>“I saw what happened to-night in the
supper-room,” she said. “Won’t you”&mdash;her
voice broke, and there came to it a
strangely beseeching note&mdash;“won’t you tell
me what it is?”</p>

<p>Julian’s face grew rather set, and he
paused a moment. Then he said, still in
the same tone:</p>

<p>“It is nothing that I need worry you
about, dear.”</p>

<p>“Something might be done. If I knew
what it was it could be set right, I know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">{87}</a></span></p>

<p>“No, dear!” The words came from
Julian quickly and instantly, and there was
a decision and significance behind his light
tone now. Her speech had created a necessity,
and he rose instinctively to meet it. “I’m
awfully sorry to distress you, but I assure
you nothing can be done. A girl must be
allowed to know her own mind, you know.
And a certain little question asked and
answered, the only thing left to the fellow
is to retire gracefully. I’m awfully sorry you
are cut up about it; I was afraid you would
be. Never mind, dear. I’m in no particular
hurry.”</p>

<p>He had gained in fluency and expansiveness
of manner as he proceeded; the expedient
had only occurred to him on the spur of the
moment; and as he finished he bent down
and kissed her lightly on the forehead.</p>

<p>“Good night,” he said. “Sleep as well
as I intend to do.”</p>

<p>He left her with a nod and a smile,
shutting the door behind him, and Mrs.
Romayne stood for a moment motionless,
as she had received his kiss, staring at the
door through which he had disappeared.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">{88}</a></span>
Then she began to rub her hands feebly
against one another as though a great cold
had seized her. She was trembling from
head to foot.</p>

<p>“Failed!”</p>

<p>She spoke the word half aloud in a low,
shivering tone, which gave to its isolated
utterance a strangely weird effect.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Marston</span> Loring was sitting at his writing-table,
writing with an intentness which
harmonised oddly with the suggestion of his
evening dress&mdash;correct and up-to-date in the
minutest particular. He had come rapidly
out from the inner room two or three minutes
before, evidently acting upon a recently-formed
determination; and he was writing now
swiftly and decisively. But there was nothing
of rashness or impulsiveness about his face
or manner as he wrote; they were even
keener, more calculating and cynical than
usual. He finished his note, directed it with
the same decision, pushed it aside, and, taking
up an open letter which had been lying before
him as he wrote, leant back in his chair, and
began to re-read it. The note, on which the
ink was scarcely dry, was addressed to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">{90}</a></span>
broker in the City. The letter which he had
taken up bore the postmark of a small town
in South Africa, and was marked “Private”
and “Urgent.”</p>

<p>Three days had passed since Julian’s
explanation to his mother as to his relations
with Miss Pomeroy.</p>

<p>Marston Loring had come back from
South Africa three months before, with some
very excellent machinery ready to his hand
for the production of what would materially
simplify and embellish his future career&mdash;a
large fortune. That the machinery was such
as a man of honour would have hesitated to
put in motion; that the hands which worked
it could hardly escape unstained, affected him
not at all. The stains were not such as could
be pointed at; it was hardly likely that they
would be detected. Certain fellow mechanics
were necessary to the proceedings; one of these
he had found in Ramsay; the other he had
created, so to speak, in Julian Romayne.</p>

<p>The first noticeable production of that
machinery had been that first decisive rise
in “Welcomes” at the end of June; and
since that time it had been worked&mdash;mainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">{91}</a></span>
by the master-mechanics, Ramsay and Loring&mdash;with
unceasing skill, energy, and unscrupulousness.
Various causes had co-operated
to prevent such a speedy consummation as
Loring had anticipated when he told Julian
that the inside of a month would see the end
of the proceedings. The month had gone by,
and the shares, though they were now worth
ten times as much as had been paid for them
by the three in whose hands they lay,
had not yet touched the highest value to
which it was proposed to raise them&mdash;to which
they were rising, as a matter of fact, with
ever-increasing rapidity. And yet, notwithstanding
the apparent certainty that in
another week his shares would have materially
increased in value, the note which Loring
had just written contained instructions for the
disposal of all his interest in the Welcome
Diamond Mining Company, without fail, on
the following day.</p>

<p>A very small stone will put out of gear
the most skilfully constructed and reliable
machine. A very small modicum of fact will
reduce the most skilful and elaborate fiction
to its elements. The letter which Loring was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">{92}</a></span>
studying now with knit brows and compressed
lips brought him private information, which
he knew might be public property twenty-four
hours later, to the effect that the Welcome
Diamond Mine was under water. As soon as
that fact was generally made known, shares in
the Company would be practically worthless.</p>

<p>He folded the letter and sat for a moment
tapping it meditatively against the table.
He was thinking deeply; not now about the
actual contents of the letter, but of a question
which they had raised in his mind; a question
interwoven and complicated with other carefully-laid
plans. Finally he threw the letter
down on the table with a movement of sudden
resolution.</p>

<p>“I must!” he said to himself. “It won’t
do to risk a row.”</p>

<p>He glanced hastily at his watch, and then
drew out a sheet of note-paper and wrote
rapidly:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">“<span class="smcap">Dear Julian</span>,</p>

<p>“Be here to-morrow at ten sharp.
Don’t fail.</p>

<p class="center">“Yours,</p>

<p class="center">“<span class="smcap">Marston Loring</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">{93}</a></span></p>

<p>He directed the letter, and then rose
quickly, took up the hat and light overcoat
lying on a chair near him, and went
out with the letter in his hand. At the
porter’s lodge he stopped. “Get this sent
by hand this evening,” he said, giving the
man the letter addressed to Julian. The
other letter he posted himself as he passed
along the Strand.</p>

<p>He was on his way to dine in Curzon
Street, and among his subsequent engagements
for the evening the Academy soirée occupied
a prominent place.</p>

<p>It was nearly twelve o’clock when he
arrived at Burlington House, and the vestibule
and staircase were alike crowded with people
going up and coming down; smiling, nodding,
and generally obstructing the way, with a
bland oblivion of any but their own individual
rights to a passage.</p>

<p>At the foot of the stairs Loring was
seized upon and absorbed in a portentous
obstruction, of which the centre figure was
Mrs. Halse, a truly electrifying figure in a
painfully fashionable evening “frock” of a
brilliant green.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">{94}</a></span></p>

<p>“I was just looking for a man,” she said,
in her usual strident tones. “They get such
an extraordinary lot of people together here
that picking out any one one knows is like
looking for a needle in a bundle of hay. I
suppose nobody ever did look for a needle in
a bundle of hay, by-the-bye. Mr. Halse isn’t
here, of course”&mdash;Mr. Halse was seldom
known to appear in public, and when he did
so, his meek presence was obviously entirely
devoid of interest for his wife&mdash;“and I’m
looking after Hilda Compton; her husband’s
coming to fetch her, but he doesn’t care about
her going about alone. Quite right, too, I
tell him,” she added, with a laugh. “But of
course it won’t last.”</p>

<p>Hilda Compton, a three months’ bride,
was standing by looking like a Hilda Newton
who had been born and bred in the centre
of London society, daring in dress, self-possessed
in manner, audaciously pretty in face.</p>

<p>She echoed Mrs. Halse’s laugh, and the
latter went on, to Loring:</p>

<p>“You can come upstairs with us. It’s
such a bore not to have a man!” and turning,
led the way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">{95}</a></span></p>

<p>That characteristic feature in her vociferous
personality&mdash;Mrs. Halse’s hobbies&mdash;had
become crystallised to a great extent since
Hilda Newton’s engagement and marriage
into a passion for matrimonial affairs; not
necessarily for match-making; match-marring
was quite as keen an interest with
her.</p>

<p>The comments with which she beguiled
their way into the first room were mainly
called forth by the young men and maidens
of her acquaintance who happened to catch
her eye, and whom she suspected of mutual
likings or loathings. They had drifted halfway
across the room without coming within
speaking distance of any one they knew, when
Mrs. Halse broke off in an energetically-whispered
account of a certain pretty young
woman’s partiality for&mdash;according to Mrs.
Halse&mdash;an unresponsive young man, and
exclaimed suddenly:</p>

<p>“That’s Maud Pomeroy over there, isn’t
it? It’s my belief that she wears those
ridiculous white dresses so that people may
have something to remember her by. There’s
nothing in her face, that’s certain!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">{96}</a></span></p>

<p>Loring glanced through the doorway into
the other room, to where Miss Pomeroy, in
white silk, was smiling very prettily upon
a young man who was obviously, if his
countenance was to be relied upon, making
inane remarks to her. He was a very rich
young man, and he had lately succeeded to
a title. Loring smiled rather enigmatically.</p>

<p>“It is surely impossible to associate two
such dissimilar ideas as artifice and Miss
Pomeroy&mdash;oil and water, you know.”</p>

<p>“Milk and water, you mean!” put in
Mrs. Compton, with a laugh.</p>

<p>Mrs. Halse responded to the little witticism
with obstreperous hilarity, and then turned
suddenly and confidentially to Loring, and
spoke in an eager semi-whisper:</p>

<p>“Now, perhaps you can tell me,” she
said; “nobody who knows her seems to
have been able to pick up anything&mdash;not
that she has any intimate friends, that kind
of girl never has. But you know him, and
men gossip much more than women, when
all’s said and done. Has she behaved infamously
to him, or has he behaved infamously
to her?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">{97}</a></span></p>

<p>“Has who behaved infamously to whom?”
said Loring, smiling.</p>

<p>Mrs. Halse unfurled her fan, and began to
waft it vigorously and excitedly to and fro.</p>

<p>“You do know something about it!” she
exclaimed. “Hilda, he wouldn’t fence like
that unless he knew something. But you’re
not going to get out of it like that,” she
continued, addressing herself again to Loring.
“I’ll tell you plainly of whom I am talking,
and you’ll tell me plainly what has happened.
Maud Pomeroy is the she, and young Romayne
is the he. Now, then.”</p>

<p>“I give you my word that I know
nothing about it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you,” was the answer,
given with uncompromising vigour and directness.
“Good heavens! Somebody must know
something about it. A month ago the Romaynes
and the Pomeroys were never apart.
You couldn’t go into a room without seeing
him making eyes at her, and her simpering
up at him, and their respective mammas
exchanging confidences in corners. I was
within an ace of congratulating them all
round heaps of times. I lived with my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">{98}</a></span>
mouth open to do it, so to speak; they all
seemed so keen about it, it was evidently
a matter for fervent congratulation. Though
why Mrs. Pomeroy should have cared about
it I can’t think!” this parenthetically. “He
won’t have anything of his own while his
mother lives. I suppose Maud fancied him!
It’s my belief that that poor woman daren’t
call her soul her own where Miss Maud is
concerned!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Halse paused, but only for the purpose
of taking breath. That very necessary
process being accomplished, she continued her
summary of the position:</p>

<p>“Then she goes to stay with prospective
mamma-in-law, and we all stand on tip-toe
and hold our breath. She spends a fortnight
there, and the next thing we know is that
the whole affair is apparently off! Off, if
you please! No more making of eyes, no
more simperings, no more confidences. And
no explanation of any sort or kind. Mr.
Loring, I cannot stand it, and I insist on
knowing what you know.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Halse, you do know what I know&mdash;that
is&mdash;nothing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">{99}</a></span></p>

<p>If a large and smart lady could by any
possibility permit herself to stamp a large
and heavy foot in the midst of a crowded
and fashionable assembly, Mrs. Halse stamped
hers at that moment. She gazed for an
instant into Loring’s imperturbable face, and
then, becoming convinced of his sincerity,
she turned to Mrs. Compton with a gesture
of despair.</p>

<p>“Hilda!” she said, “if somebody doesn’t
find out something soon, I shall die of
suspense!”</p>

<p>As it seemed not improbable from her
demeanour at the moment that she would
obviate the chances of such a calamity by
hurling herself upon one of the objects of
her interest and wresting a solution of the
mystery from him or her by main force, it
was perhaps as well that at that moment a
temporary distraction presented itself in the
shape of a popular actor. Mrs. Halse was
very fond of popular actors; they had been
a hobby with her at one time. And in the
movement and breaking up of the group
which ensued, Loring drifted quietly away.</p>

<p>He had made his way gradually into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">{100}</a></span>
big room, when he suddenly quickened his
steps and began to thread his way skilfully
and rapidly through the crowd. Mrs. Romayne
was standing on the opposite side of
the room, smiling an invitation to him to
come and speak to her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Romayne had not been looking her
best lately. Somehow the piquant style and
daring colour which she affected hardly suited
her as they had been wont to do. To-night
there was a tired look upon her face which
seemed to reveal some recently-traced lines
about her mouth; lines of intense and almost
dogged determination; and to her sparkling
eyes, if she allowed them a moment’s repose,
there came a haggard look, which had seemed
for the last three days to lie only just
beneath the surface. But these were subtle,
hardly perceptible points, and for the rest
she remained a noticeably attractive woman
of the most pronounced artificial type.</p>

<p>“Where’s the boy?” said Loring easily,
when they had shaken hands. “Is he here?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Romayne shook her head and
laughed.</p>

<p>“No!” she said. “He rather bars the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">{101}</a></span>
soirée. A mistake, I think. One must take
it for what it is, of course; an omnium-gatherum
of a perfectly preposterous nature;
looked at from that point of view it’s not
unfunny! Do look at that girl over there!
She thinks her garment is a revelation to all
beholders!”</p>

<p>“So it is,” returned Loring drily.</p>

<p>Mrs. Romayne laughed, and dropped the
glasses with which she had been coolly
surveying the garment in question.</p>

<p>“That was rather obvious, wasn’t it?”
she said gaily. “By-the-bye, did you want
to see Julian?”</p>

<p>There was a moment’s pause after Loring
had replied, pleasantly enough, in the negative,
and then Mrs. Romayne looked up at him
suddenly, and said:</p>

<p>“It’s frightfully hot in here, don’t you
think? Suppose we try one of the less
popular rooms?” She stopped a moment,
and then added with her most artificial laugh:
“Of course, you gather from that that I’m
going to victimise you again? Yes; I do
want a little quiet talk with you. Who’d be
a conspirator?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">{102}</a></span></p>

<p>There was nothing of the unwilling victim,
at least, in Loring’s tone or manner as he
deprecated her words. Nor was there either
reluctance or tedium in his face as he followed
her through the room. On the contrary, it
was almost lighted up by an expression of
sudden purpose.</p>

<p>Mrs. Romayne led the way to the almost
deserted miniature room, and they began to
walk slowly up and down, to all intents and
purposes alone together. There seemed to be
no particular point to Mrs. Romayne’s desire
for a private conference with her fellow-conspirator.
She talked about Julian; talked
about him carelessly, artificially, but with a
persistence which only another mother could
have understood; slipping in little questions
now and then on all sorts of details connected
with that business side of a man’s life, as
to which, she said, “women are always so
in the dark;” and reverting again and again
to her satisfaction and reliance in his
mentor.</p>

<p>“It’s rather absurd to quote those ridiculous
old proverbs,” she said at last, laughing
affectedly, “but isn’t there one, or a fable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">{103}</a></span>
or something, about a duck whose chickens&mdash;no,
a hen whose chickens, it would be,
wouldn’t it?&mdash;would take to the water, and
agitated her awfully because she couldn’t go
after them? That’s exactly what I feel like,
I assure you. And I look upon you as an
exceptionally sensible water-bird who is also
at home on the land&mdash;a kind of connecting
link. Humiliating similes, aren’t they?”</p>

<p>Loring smiled in answer to her laugh.
But his tone as he answered her was rather
grave.</p>

<p>“Not by any means humiliating as far
as I am concerned,” he said; “for you assume
a certain amount of sympathy between yourself
and me. May I tell you what a pleasure
that idea gives me?”</p>

<p>He spoke slowly and deliberately, and
Mrs. Romayne started slightly. She glanced
up at his face for an instant, unfurling her
fan, and using it gently, as though the movement
were an outlet for some sort of faint
agitation. Loring was not looking at her,
his eyes were fixed for the moment on the
opposite wall, and his profile told her nothing.
There was a hardly perceptible pause, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">{104}</a></span>
then he went on, with an admirable mixture
of deference, admiration&mdash;the depth of which
seemed the greater in that it was rather
suggested than expressed&mdash;and the practical
confidence of a man of the world.</p>

<p>“Don’t think that I am underrating
Julian,” he said, “or that my regard for him,
personally, is anything but a very warm and
sincere affair, when I tell you that it is a
long time now since Julian has figured in my
thoughts as anything but his mother’s son.
Because he is his mother’s son there are very
few things I would not do for him, very little
trouble I would not take for him.”</p>

<p>He hardly paused. Mrs. Romayne, rather,
broke in on his speech with a high-pitched
laugh.</p>

<p>“That’s very kind and flattering,” she
said, and there was something astonishingly
hasty and nervous in the way she
spoke.</p>

<p>“I hope it doesn’t come upon you quite
as a surprise,” answered Loring, with the
slightest suggestion of a cynical smile unseen
by Mrs. Romayne. “I hope it doesn’t need
any words of mine to show you what I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">{105}</a></span>
tried to show you in more practical ways.
You have honoured me with a great deal of
confidence, and you have honoured me still
further by putting it in my power to be of
some slight service to you. Will you not
give me still further powers in that direction?
Will you not make our interests practically
one by becoming my wife?”</p>

<p>He turned to her as he finished, and in
spite of the admirable composure and deference
with which he had spoken, his eyes
were very eager and elated, almost as though
with anticipated triumph.</p>

<p>Mrs. Romayne met his eyes, and stood
for a moment gazing into them speechless
and motionless, as though the blank astonishment
written on every line of her face had
absolutely paralysed her.</p>

<p>“Mr. Loring!” she said at last, and there
was an almost bewildered remonstrance in
her low, astonished tone. “My dear Mr.
Loring!”</p>

<p>“One moment,” he interposed quickly.
“Of course, I don’t ask you to look upon
it as anything but a question of expediency
and mutual goodwill and esteem. We are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">{106}</a></span>
both of us very well aware that London is
not Arcadia! You won’t consider it brutal
frankness on my part, I’m sure, if I tell
you that from a financial point of view our
positions are not unequal. I have been
exceptionally fortunate lately, and I can
offer you an income of about five thousand
a year. And if a man’s assistance and
support counts for something in your life,
as I hope it may&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Mrs. Romayne interrupted him. With
all the tact and practicality of a woman of
the world, she had mastered her amazement
and was mistress of the situation. She
spoke kindly and composedly, with just that
touch of delicate concern which the occasion
demanded.</p>

<p>“Don’t say any more, please; it is really
quite impossible.”</p>

<p>A sudden flash of surprise passed across
Marston Loring’s face, and he paused a
moment, his keen eyes fixed scrutinisingly
on her face. He was trying to detect there
some signs of that coquetry or affectation
of reluctance which he believed must surely
underlie her words. His scrutiny failed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">{107}</a></span>
detect anything of the kind, however, and
an unpleasant glitter came into his eyes.</p>

<p>“Impossible is a rather curt word,” he
said. “May I ask you to amplify it?”</p>

<p>He saw the colour rise beneath her paint
as she answered:</p>

<p>“I have not the faintest intention of
marrying, in the first place. And even if
there were not innumerable other reasons
against what you propose, I’m afraid I
have no fancy for making myself ridiculous!
Oh, of course I am well aware”&mdash;she laughed
a little&mdash;“that in my capacity of silly old
mother I am as ridiculous as any woman
need be! But really, I cannot add another
farcical part to that farcical rôle.”</p>

<p>“And that farcical part would be&mdash;&mdash;?”
enquired Loring.</p>

<p>“That of the old wife of a young
husband,” she answered, with artificial mirth.
“Mr. Loring, I am really sorrier, if you
are indeed disappointed, than I can tell
you. If you have thought that I encouraged
you&mdash;&mdash; But that is too utterly
preposterous! I have considered you simply
as my son’s friend&mdash;almost my son’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">{108}</a></span>
contemporary&mdash;a young man with an exceptionally
wise and reliable head. Certainly
not as a young man who would be foolish
enough to want to marry a woman old
enough to be his mother.”</p>

<p>Loring’s lips were rather thin, and his
eyes glittered dangerously. As she stood
looking at him then, with a certain softening
excitement about her face, there was no
slightest suggestion of age about her; nothing
but an admirably developed and preserved
maturity. And Loring was a young man
in nothing but years.</p>

<p>“That is a mere form of words, if you
will pardon my saying so,” he said, and
his voice was dangerously quiet and controlled.
“There is difference between us in
years, of course, but that goes for nothing.
In experience, in knowledge of the world,
if I may say so, the difference between us is
practically nil. I am, as you say, your son’s
friend. But is that a reason for refusing me
a larger form of the right which you yourself
have pressed upon me, to watch over him
and to supplement your care where it must
inevitably fall short? For Julian’s sake!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">{109}</a></span></p>

<p>He was confronting her now, looking
straight down at her, and as he spoke the
last words, all the concern and agitation,
partly affected, partly real, with which her
face had been moved, vanished before a set
expression of unalterable resolution.</p>

<p>“For Julian’s sake,” she said, in a low,
decisive voice, “it is impossible.”</p>

<p>He stood for a moment watching her,
all the evil of his face standing out in
intense relief, and then he made a slight,
cold gesture of acquiescence.</p>

<p>“May I take you back into the large
room?” he said.</p>

<p>She held out her hand to him with an
eager gesture of apology and appeal.</p>

<p>“We are friends still?” she murmured.
And the murmur was almost pathetically
genuine in its anxiety. “It makes no
difference?”</p>

<p>Loring’s mouth was not good to look at
as he answered in a tone absolutely destitute
of expression:</p>

<p>“Certainly not!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">{110}</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">If</span> evil thoughts and evil passions could have
a tangible effect upon the physical atmosphere,
the air of Marston Loring’s room, an hour
later, should have been thick and heavy. He
was sitting thrown back in an easy-chair, his
evening coat replaced by a smoking jacket, a
glass of whisky and seltzer-water close to his
hand. There were also cigars on the table,
but he was not smoking. He was staring
straight before him into vacancy. His face
was pale and set with vindictive passion, to
the existence of which in his nature the
general callousness of his expression gave no
clue.</p>

<p>It was many years since Marston Loring
had felt as he felt to-night. It was many
years since he had been foiled and thwarted&mdash;“made
a fool of,” as he himself would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">{111}</a></span>
said; and all that was blackest and worst in
the man was roused by the process. His life,
ever since he had realised, at the age of
twenty-five, that there were prizes in the
world which some men obtained and other
men failed to obtain, had been ruled by a
series of carefully made and elaborately worked
out calculations. Everything he had done,
and everything he had not done, had been
included in one or other of these calculations;
carefully designed to meet certain ends, all of
which met and culminated in the one great
end of existence as he conceived it&mdash;material
prosperity and position.</p>

<p>He had been, perhaps, as vicious a youth
as could have been found in London, and he
had not ceased to be vicious as a man. But
he so managed his vices that even the reputation
which clung to him had contributed to
his success. The question of marriage he had
discussed with himself on more than one
occasion, always solely from the point of view
of expediency. And just about the time
when Mrs. Romayne made her appearance in
London society he had come to the conclusion
that, given the right sort of woman, the step<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">{112}</a></span>
might possibly prove advantageous. He had
been considerably struck by Mrs. Romayne
from the first; she was the kind of woman he
greatly admired, and he was well aware that
to be on terms of intimacy with such a social
power was an excellent thing for a man in
his position; a position which, as he was
also well aware, was by no means so
secure as most people supposed. It was from
this point of view that he had cultivated
Julian, and, at first, from this point of view
only. The idea of Mrs. Romayne as a possible
wife occurred to him later. But when it did
occur, it developed into active intention with
considerable rapidity.</p>

<p>He had looked at the question from every
possible point of view, and decided that
nothing could suit him better. He had
no taste for young women. He admired
Mrs. Romayne as much as it was possible to
him to admire any one; she was “the kind of
woman he could get on with,” he told himself.
She possessed exceptional advantages in the
matter of social standing, and she had money.
Her eager cultivation of him during the
autumn that followed her first season in town<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">{113}</a></span>
convinced him that with a little trouble she
could be brought to forget the disadvantage of
his comparative poverty; and he would have
proposed to her in the ensuing winter had not
his voyage to the Cape prevented. He had
come back with the prospect of a fortune of his
own. But the fact made no difference to his
matrimonial plans. Where there is money
more money is always to be desired. Mrs.
Romayne’s fortune was no longer absolutely
necessary to him, but it had not ceased to be
desirable, and her other advantages remained
intact. She had received him with enthusiasm,
she had cultivated him assiduously;
she had absolutely led him on, as it seemed to
Loring. He, in common with the rest of the
world, regarded her relations with her son as
the merest pose, and her appeal for his help
with Julian had seemed to him simply the
most transparent of subterfuges. He had no
more doubted that she would accept him
than he had doubted his own existence. And
now his plans were frustrated, his calculations
were falsified, and his very practical and
material castles in the air were laid in the
dust. He was refused.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">{114}</a></span></p>

<p>He roused himself at last, and the faintest
suggestion of a cruel smile curved his thin
lips. He lifted the glass by his side, drank
off its contents, and then turned out the lamp
and went into the inner room.</p>

<p>His face was quite itself the next morning;
the scowl and the cruelty had alike disappeared;
and it was with an even less
cynical smile than usual that he looked up
from his morning paper at a few minutes
past ten o’clock, as the door opened with a
hasty knock, and Julian Romayne appeared.</p>

<p>“Good morning, dear boy!” said Loring
pleasantly.</p>

<p>“Morning, old man!” responded Julian.</p>

<p>He was looking rather pale and anxious,
and he went on quickly:</p>

<p>“Nothing wrong with ‘Welcomes,’ I
hope?”</p>

<p>Loring smiled again.</p>

<p>“Nothing in the world, as far as I know,”
he said gaily. “What a nervous fellow you
are!”</p>

<p>“What an unreasonable fellow you are!”
retorted Julian, the cloud vanishing from his
face as if by magic. “What do you mean by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">{115}</a></span>
dragging a poor wretch down here at this hour
in the morning, whether he will or no?
What’s up?”</p>

<p>It was some legal business, it appeared;
and Loring proceeded to go into it with great
circumstance. It sounded very important as
he put it, but Julian took his leave, declaring
gaily that he “didn’t see where the urgency
came in.”</p>

<p>“You’re such an abominably hard-working
fellow!” he said lightly.</p>

<p>“Perhaps!” returned Loring. “It’s not
such a bad principle, and it’s an excellent
character to have, let me tell you. By-the-bye,
Julian,” he continued, as the young man
turned away with a laugh, and laid his hand
on the door, “how would you like to have a
few more Welcomes?”</p>

<p>He rose as he spoke, and stood leaning
against the mantelpiece with his back to the
empty grate, confronting Julian as the young
man turned sharply towards him.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” said Julian.
“Are there any in the market?”</p>

<p>“Well, yes,” said Loring quietly. “The
fact is, there’s a certain shooting in Scotland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">{116}</a></span>
which I have coveted for years. It’s for sale
now, and on uncommonly reasonable terms.
Of course, it’s appalling extravagance on my
part, for the shares are going up every day.
But I am going to sell a thousand pounds’
worth of Welcomes to-day and buy that
moor.”</p>

<p>“It is extravagance!” said Julian, and
there was an eager light in his blue eyes.</p>

<p>“Like to have the shares?” said Loring
imperturbably.</p>

<p>Julian hesitated.</p>

<p>“I should like them, of course,” he said,
rather breathlessly. “So would lots of other
fellows. But, you see, my thousands, what
there were of them, are all locked up in the
Welcome already.”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t think it worth while
to borrow, I suppose?” enquired Loring carelessly.</p>

<p>“There’s a little difficulty known as
security.”</p>

<p>“For some fellows, of course,” was the
answer. “But not for you. You’ve got money
coming to you.”</p>

<p>Julian coloured a dull red, and looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">{117}</a></span>
down at the carpet, moving his foot to and fro
uneasily.</p>

<p>The idea of raising money on a reversion
for such a purpose was for the moment inexpressibly
repugnant to him.</p>

<p>“The shares are going up every day,”
said Loring; “you ought to make a good
thing of it; and you’ll sell at the end of
this week, I take it? However, of course, I
don’t want to press you. They’ll go off fast
enough.”</p>

<p>Julian lifted his head suddenly, and
drove his clenched hand deep down into his
pocket.</p>

<p>“I’ll do it,” he said. “All right, Loring,
I’ll take them.”</p>

<p>“To-day?” said Loring suavely.</p>

<p>“To-day!” returned Julian, almost
fiercely.</p>

<p>He turned and left the room abruptly,
without another word. And Loring, with
the smile of the night before touching his lips
once more, took up his paper again. Apparently
he had forgotten the letter he had
received from South Africa on the previous
day, and the news it contained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">{118}</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> was six o’clock on the following day, and
in the sunset light of the July evening&mdash;a
light with which the bustling, hurrying,
unlovely crowd on which it fell seemed
strangely out of harmony&mdash;the current of
human life was setting strongly in every
direction from the City. Along Cornhill, going
against the stream, but driven, nevertheless,
at a pace which was looked upon far from
favourably by the police occupied in regulating
the traffic, there came a hansom cab. In the
cab, with one hand gripping the doors until
the knuckles stood out white, was Julian
Romayne. His hat was pulled slightly forward
over his brow, as if with some half-conscious
sense of the ghastliness of his face, some
instinct to hide that ghastliness from casual
eyes. His face was of a livid pallor. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">{119}</a></span>
were grey shadows about the mouth, which
was set into hard lines of temporary and
difficult self-control. His nostrils, not sensitive
as a rule, quivered slightly as the pace of his
horse slackened perforce now and again; he
gave no other slightest sign of consciousness
of his surroundings.</p>

<p>The cab turned out of Cornhill, and in
another second pulled up suddenly. Almost
before the cab had stopped, Julian flung open
the doors and leapt out. He paid the man
double his fare, dashed into the building before
which they had stopped, and up the stairs
to an office on the second floor. His hand
was shaking like a leaf as he stretched it out
to try the lock of the door. It yielded to his
touch, and he flung it roughly open and passed
rapidly in. The outer office had only one
occupant, a rather feeble-looking little man,
who was trying to improve the appearance of
a shabby hat by a careful application of his
coat-sleeve. He looked up with a start on
Julian’s entrance, and an expression of comprehending
concern dawned on his face.
He was the messenger of the Welcome
Diamond Mining Company. Before he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">{120}</a></span>
speak, however, a hoarse, peremptory question
broke from Julian:</p>

<p>“Mr. Ramsay’s not gone?”</p>

<p>“Not yet, sir,” was the answer, given
with timid alacrity. “He’s here later
than usual to-night, you see, in consequence&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>But before the first words were fairly
uttered, Julian had crossed the room, and
as he reached the second door leading into the
inner office, it opened quietly, and Ramsay
stood on the threshold. He was looking as
imperturbable and uninterested as usual,
and his voice was dry indifference itself as he
observed:</p>

<p>“I have been expecting you all day.”</p>

<p>Without a word Julian strode past him
into the manager’s room, and then, as Ramsay
shut the door calmly, he said, in a quick,
unnatural tone, which also carried with it a
curious suggestion that he had not even heard
Ramsay’s words:</p>

<p>“It’s a mistake! It’s a mistake! It
must be!”</p>

<p>Ramsay’s only answer was a slight shrug
of the shoulders as his dull eyes rested, apparently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">{121}</a></span>
with complete indifference, upon
Julian’s face; and the latter went on, rapidly
and unevenly:</p>

<p>“I’ve only just heard. I’ve been out of
town all day. I’ve come to hear&mdash;to see what
can be done.”</p>

<p>The last words were hardly audible, as
though his mouth was so parched that he
could hardly articulate. He lifted his hand
as if involuntarily, and pushed back his hat,
fixing a pair of fierce, burning eyes upon
Ramsay.</p>

<p>“There’s nothing to be done, of course,”
said Ramsay drily. “The thing’s collapsed.”</p>

<p>A harsh, wild laugh rang through the
room, its faint echoes startling the little man
in the outer office.</p>

<p>“Collapsed!” cried Julian. “Collapsed,
by Heaven!”</p>

<p>He put out one hand gropingly, caught
at a chair near him and dropped heavily
into it, letting his face fall forward upon
his folded arms as they rested upon its
back.</p>

<p>Only half an hour had passed since he
had gone to his rooms in the Temple after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">{122}</a></span>
a picnic on the river, to find waiting for him
there a telegram from Ramsay. And into that
half-hour had been compressed such a desperate
stand against despair as is little less terrible
than despair itself. The telegram had told
him that on the opening of the Stock Exchange
that morning it had been spread abroad on
unimpeachable authority that the Welcome
Diamond Mine was under water. This evening,
the inevitable sequel of such a fact, as he
knew too well, shares in the Welcome
Diamond Mining Company were so much
waste-paper.</p>

<p>Ramsay stood for a moment looking at
him, with a rather curious expression on his
inexpressive face.</p>

<p>“It’s a turn of the game,” he said drily.
“If you stand to win, you must stand to
lose, too. You hadn’t thought of that, I
suppose?”</p>

<p>With a sudden tumultuous movement,
as though his agony of mind was no longer
to be endured in stillness, Julian sprang
from his chair and began to walk up and
down the room with hasty, uneven strides.</p>

<p>“Thought of it!” he cried. “What was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">{123}</a></span>
there to make one think of it? It was a
certainty yesterday, man; a certainty!”</p>

<p>A spasm passed across his face, and seemed
to cut off his words, and Ramsay observed
sententiously:</p>

<p>“It’s a mistake to reckon anything as a
certainty till you hold it in your hand.”</p>

<p>Julian faced round suddenly and confronted
him, his eyes blazing, every feature
working.</p>

<p>“What the devil is the good of saying
things like that?” he demanded. “Can’t
you understand that I have reckoned on
it, as you call it? Can’t you understand
that it was all or nothing with me,
and I am just done? Can’t you understand&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He broke off suddenly, and, turning away
with a heavy groan, flung himself into a chair,
and let his face fall forward on the table. For
all that he was face to face with at that
moment he could have found no words. The
remorse, the sense of failure and helplessness,
the despair which seemed to be
tearing his heart to pieces, were one intolerable
anguish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">{124}</a></span></p>

<p>Ramsay followed him with his eyes,
and then crossed the room quietly, and
stood beside his bowed figure, which was
shaken now and again from head to foot.</p>

<p>“Is it so bad as this, boy?” he said
quietly. Then, as there came no answer,
he went on meditatively: “Ten thousand
pounds! Ten thousand isn’t so much to lose.
Counters in the game, that’s all.”</p>

<p>He paused, and after a moment Julian
lifted his face, haggard and drawn.</p>

<p>“It’s the stake you must look to,” he said.
“My stake was heavy, Ramsay. Oh, you’re
right enough. Ten thousand pounds isn’t
much. I borrowed a thousand yesterday&mdash;raised
it on a reversion&mdash;to get hold of some
shares Loring wanted to sell. That wasn’t
much either, of course.”</p>

<p>He had spoken in a dreary, monotonous
voice, which was inexpressibly hopeless. And
Ramsay’s eyes were fixed keenly on him as
their owner said drily:</p>

<p>“You bought a thousand pounds’ worth of
Loring’s shares yesterday? Did you know
that he was selling out all his interest in the
Welcome?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">{125}</a></span></p>

<p>Julian turned with a quick, startled movement,
and then paused.</p>

<p>“All his interest?” he repeated. “He
wanted a thousand to pay for a Scotch moor,
that was all.”</p>

<p>“He sold every share he had yesterday,”
returned Ramsay. “Curious coincidence.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to tell me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The eyes of the two men met; and Julian
sprang to his feet with a fierce imprecation.</p>

<p>“He knew it?” he cried; “he knew it,
and kept it dark, that he might keep the
market to himself? It isn’t possible, Ramsay;
it isn’t possible!”</p>

<p>“Nothing is impossible,” returned Ramsay
quietly.</p>

<p>A savage, hissing breath came from between
Julian’s set teeth, and he seemed
literally alive with passion. Without a word
he stretched out his hand for his hat and
turned to leave the room. Ramsay quietly
intercepted his passage.</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” he said.</p>

<p>“I’m going to see Mr. Loring.”</p>

<p>The slightest possible smile touched the
elder man’s lips, and he said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">{126}</a></span></p>

<p>“All right. I shall have something to say
to Mr. Loring, too. But listen to me, first.
Was it a desperate necessity to you to pull off
this affair?”</p>

<p>Julian did not speak. His lips twitched
for a moment, then settled into a thin
line; and the look in his eyes was answer
enough.</p>

<p>“Very good, then,” said Ramsay. “Come
and see me here to-morrow at six. I may
be able to give you a hand.”</p>

<p>With a gesture of uncomprehending assent,
but with no word of answer, Julian turned
away and left the room.</p>

<p class="tb">Three-quarters of an hour later he was
coming rapidly down the staircase which led
from Loring’s chambers. His face was flushed
and quivering, and every pulse was beating
madly, like the pulses of a man who has just
given unrestrained expression to furious
passion. He turned on to the Embankment,
and began to walk away in a headlong fashion,
evidently neither knowing nor caring where he
was going.</p>

<p>And as he walked the tumultuous life and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">{127}</a></span>
glow of his face died slowly out, and settled
into a haggard, sullen mask of dull despair.
He had spoken his mind to Loring, and now
there was nothing more for him to do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">{128}</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">“We</span> are all the slaves of man, my dear
Lady Bracondale. You are kept in town
because Parliament insists on keeping your
husband; and I am kept in town because&mdash;oh,
because the most capricious young man
in London happens to be my son!”</p>

<p>An afternoon call in the first week of
August is distinctly an anomaly, and seems
to partake somewhat of the nature of a visit
of condolence. Parliament was sitting late
this year, and those hapless wives who considered
it their duty to wait in town until
their legislating husbands were released, visited
one another, and were visited by the one
or two acquaintances detained in London
by other causes, in a manner which betrayed
a combination of martyrdom and shamefacedness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">{129}</a></span></p>

<p>Lady Bracondale, who was nothing if
not a personification of duty done, or in the
act of doing, was being condoled with, or called
upon, on this particular August afternoon,
by two distinct sets of sympathising acquaintances;
two sets, which, in spite of placid
words and pretty speeches, seemed to be
entirely incapable of amalgamation; Mrs.
Romayne, and Mrs. Pomeroy and her daughter,
who had arrived a few minutes later. And
it was to Mrs. Pomeroy that Lady Bracondale&mdash;who
had a peculiar gift for saying in a
stately and condescending manner the things
which quicker perceptions would have recognised
as not being precisely the best things
to be said under the circumstances&mdash;turned,
as Mrs. Romayne stopped speaking.</p>

<p>“I suppose Mrs. Romayne looks upon
you as the exception that proves her rule,”
she said. “For it is not a case of manly
compulsion with you, I believe? I hope your
sister goes on well?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Pomeroy, having neither husband
nor son, was detained in town by the presence
in her house of the sister whom she had
visited earlier in the year, and who had spent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">{130}</a></span>
the last month under the care of a London
doctor. But her tone was as placid as ever
as she replied:</p>

<p>“Thank you, I believe they consider her
nearly recovered, for the time being. She
hopes to go home this week. And then Maud
and I will go and pay some country visits.
We don’t think of going abroad this year.
I shouldn’t feel easy to be out of England
while my sister remains in this state.”</p>

<p>“But that’s not compulsion at all!” exclaimed
Mrs. Romayne gaily. “You are
acting entirely on your own impulse. Now,
just consider my hard case. We were going
to Pontresina; you know I’m very fond of
Pontresina; it’s such a dear, bright, amusing
place. And we were to have started yesterday.
Now, imagine my feelings when, two nights
ago, that boy of mine came home, and said
that, on the whole, he thought he’d rather
not go abroad this year; he’s taken with
an enthusiasm for his profession, if you please,
and he must needs stay somewhere quiet&mdash;so
he says&mdash;and work at it. I must do him
the justice to say that he was awfully apologetic,
dear fellow!” Mrs. Romayne laughed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">{131}</a></span>
her little affected, maternal laugh. “He was
very anxious that I should go without him,
and even offered to give up his own plan
when he found how preposterous I thought
that part of his idea.”</p>

<p>There was not the faintest difference in
Mrs. Romayne’s voice by which it would
have been possible to tell that her last
statement was even less veracious than any
other part of her speech, and that Julian’s
proposal to give up his plan was a figment
of the moment only.</p>

<p>“And then of course I gave in,” she continued.
“Of course, he knew I should&mdash;the
wretch! And we’re to have a cottage
on the river, and spend six weeks there.”</p>

<p>She finished with a little grimace, and
Lady Bracondale observed politely:</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you will find it rather dull.”</p>

<p>“I shall find it very dull,” returned Mrs.
Romayne with ingenuous frankness. “I
shall be bored to death. But, then, you
all know that I am really a very ridiculous
woman, and if my lord and master is content,
there is nothing more to be said. He’s kind
enough to assure me that there are lots of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">{132}</a></span>
nice people about! I don’t know what
kind of nice people one is likely to find
about the river in August and September,
but I take his word for it.”</p>

<p>“I believe the Comptons have a house-boat
somewhere,” observed Miss Pomeroy.</p>

<p>It was her first contribution to the conversation,
and it was made apparently
rather because conventionality by this time
demanded a remark of some sort from her,
than from any interest in the subject.
Before any reply could be made, the door
opened, and Marston Loring was announced.</p>

<p>Mrs. Romayne had been looking rather
sharp-featured, and there was a great restlessness
in her eyes. It seemed to leap up and
then settle suddenly into comparative repose
as they rested on Marston Loring, and as
he turned to shake hands with her she
greeted him gaily. It was their first meeting
since the night of the Academy soirée,
but Loring’s manner was absolutely unmoved.
His greeting to her differed in nowise from
his greeting to the other two ladies, and
if that fact in itself involved a subtle
change in his demeanour towards her, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">{133}</a></span>
change was observed by one pair of eyes
only&mdash;a pair of demure brown eyes. Miss
Pomeroy had been a good deal interested
in Marston Loring’s comings and goings
during the fortnight she spent in Queen
Anne Street.</p>

<p>“I thought you were gone,” Mrs. Romayne
said lightly. “What are you doing in town
to-day, may one ask, when you were booked
to start for Norway yesterday?”</p>

<p>“Business,” he returned in a tone which
addressed the whole company rather than
any member of it individually. “I am
investing in a Scotch moor, and I can’t
leave London till I have signed and
sealed.”</p>

<p>There was a delicate implication of wealth
about the statement which seemed to give
a curious fillip to the conversation; and an
animated discussion ensued on Scotland, its
charms and its disadvantages.</p>

<p>Mrs. Romayne held her part in the
discussion with unfailing readiness, and as
the subject exhausted itself she rose to
take leave. She said good-bye in her
usual charming manner to her hostess, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">{134}</a></span>
to Mrs. Pomeroy and her daughter, and
then she turned to Loring.</p>

<p>“By-the-bye,” she said carelessly, “I’ve
a piece of property of yours in the carriage.
Did you know you had lost something when
you called the other day? No, I shan’t
tell you what it is, you very careless person!
But I’ll give it you if you like to come
down for it.”</p>

<p>She turned away; Loring followed her
perforce; and there was an ugly smile on
his face as he did so. At the foot of the
stairs she paused; then with a quick glance
towards an open door which led into a
dining room, she went rapidly towards it,
signing to him to follow her. Once within
the room, she turned and faced him. She
was smiling still, but the smile was stiff
and mechanical, and her eyes, as she fixed
them on his face, were desperately anxious.
There was a curious ring of conscious
helplessness and reliance on the man to
whom she spoke, about her voice as she
began to speak.</p>

<p>“I wanted to speak to you,” she said.
“I’m so glad to see you. I’m rather perplexed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">{135}</a></span>
Julian has taken it into his head
to stop in town, or, rather, close to town.
He won’t go abroad; he won’t visit. Can
you tell me the reason? Will you try and
find out the reason? May I rely on you?
But of course I know I may.”</p>

<p>There was a tone almost of relief in her
voice, as if in the mere making of the
confidence, in the sense of companionship
and support it gave her, she found some
sort of ease.</p>

<p>And Loring smiled again as he met her
eyes.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to have to dispel an illusion
which is so flattering to me,” he said, with
the slightest possible accentuation of his
usual quiet cynicism of manner. “But it’s
useless to assume that I can be of any
further service to you.”</p>

<p>He stopped, watching with keen, relentless
eyes the effect of his words. A startled
look came to the face turned towards him.
The eyebrows were lifted and contracted with
a quick movement of perplexity. Evidently
she believed that she had not fully understood
him, for she did not speak, and he went on:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">{136}</a></span></p>

<p>“Your son and I have quarrelled. He
has insulted me grossly. For the future
we are strangers to one another. Consequently
you will see that I shall be no
longer able to keep him out of mischief.”</p>

<p>There was an indescribable tone in his
voice, ominous and vindictive. And as he
spoke, Mrs. Romayne’s face seemed to grow
old, and her eyes dilated.</p>

<p>“It can be put right,” she said, in a
quick, uncertain voice. “He will apologise.
You will forgive&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Loring interrupted her, very coldly and
incisively.</p>

<p>“He will not apologise!” he said. “And
I should not accept any apology. I needn’t
suggest, of course, that, under the circumstances,
our acquaintance, much as I regret
this, had perhaps better cease.”</p>

<p>They faced each other for another moment,
and into Mrs. Romayne’s eyes there crept
a sick despair strangely incongruous with
the surface appearance of the position. Then
she seemed to recover herself as if with a
tremendous effort of will. She drew herself
up, bowed her head with grave dignity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">{137}</a></span>
and moved to leave the room. He held
the door open for her with an absolutely
expressionless countenance. She passed down
the hall to where the servant was waiting at
the door, went out, and got into her carriage
alone.</p>

<p>Loring stood at the foot of the stairs
watching her, and then turned with a cruel
contentment in his eyes, and went upstairs
again to the drawing-room.</p>

<p>The two elder ladies were sitting with
their heads very close together, as he
opened the drawing-room door, evidently
deep in some question of domestic importance.
And standing by a conservatory
window at the other end of the room, a
rather bored-looking figure in its solitary
girlishness, was Maud Pomeroy. The occasion
being, as has been said, something of an
anomaly, conventions were not so strict as
usual. Lady Bracondale just glanced up
with a vague smile as Loring reappeared,
and then became absorbed in conversation
as he strolled across to Maud Pomeroy. She
looked up at him with a faint smile.</p>

<p>“Has Mrs. Romayne gone?” she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">{138}</a></span></p>

<p>He signified a careless assent, and then
said:</p>

<p>“You are looking rather bored, do you
know, Miss Pomeroy? Suppose we go and
look at the flowers until we’re wanted?”</p>

<p>She hesitated a moment, and then
moved idly into the conservatory, looking
back at Loring with a smile as he followed
her.</p>

<p>“I was a little bored,” she confessed.
“It is very kind of you to come and amuse
me.”</p>

<p>For the next moment or two Loring
could hardly be said to prove himself very
amusing. He sauntered round the little
conservatory at his companion’s side, his
eyes fixed keenly upon her impassive profile
with something very calculating in their
depths. Miss Pomeroy also was apparently
absorbed in thought, and did not notice
his silence.</p>

<p>“You are a great friend of the Romaynes,
are you not?” she said at last, in her thin,
even, very “proper” tones.</p>

<p>Loring glanced at her again.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “that’s not a question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">{139}</a></span>
that it’s particularly easy for me to answer,
to-day. I have been on fairly intimate terms
with them, as you know. But do you know
what that kind of thing sometimes leads to?”</p>

<p>Miss Pomeroy shook her head.</p>

<p>“Well, there is such a thing as knowing
people too well,” said Loring deliberately.
“And then you find out little traits that
don’t do. To tell you the truth, Romayne
and I have quarrelled.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad of that,” said Miss Pomeroy
softly.</p>

<p>He looked at her quickly, but he was
not quick enough to catch the spiteful gleam
in her eyes.</p>

<p>“Would it be inquisitive to enquire
why?” he said.</p>

<p>“I don’t think Mr. Romayne is a nice
young man,” was the answer. “I would
rather people I like&mdash;&mdash;” She broke off
in pretty confusion. “I would rather you
weren’t a friend of his, Mr. Loring. I think
there’s a great deal about him that nobody
knows.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” said Loring, interrogatively
and quietly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">{140}</a></span></p>

<p>“You see,” she said, with charming
seriousness, “I think a girl can often feel
whether a man is nice or nasty quicker
than another man can. Mr. Loring, has
Mr. Romayne ever said anything to you&mdash;Oh,
please don’t think it’s very odd of me
to say such things to you! Has he ever
said anything that made you think he might
be married?”</p>

<p>There was a hardly perceptible pause&mdash;a
hardly perceptible flash of comprehension
on Loring’s face, and the vindictive satisfaction
in his eyes deepened.</p>

<p>“What makes you ask me that?” he
said, in a tone which seemed to fence
gravely with the suggestion rather than to
repudiate it.</p>

<p>Miss Pomeroy responded with growing
conviction.</p>

<p>“Because I’m quite sure that he is
married. And, of course, as he doesn’t
own it, there must be something&mdash;something
not nice about it. And it does seem to
me so wrong that people should like him
so much when he isn’t a bit what they think
he is.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">{141}</a></span></p>

<p>The man’s eyes and the girl’s eyes met
at that moment for the first time. The girl’s
were perfectly clear, mild, and expressionless,
and into the man’s there stole a cynical tinge
of admiration.</p>

<p>“By Jove,” he said to himself, “she is
clever!”</p>

<p>At that instant Mrs. Pomeroy’s voice
was heard from the drawing-room calling
placidly for her daughter. And Miss
Pomeroy moved forward with graceful
promptitude into the drawing-room.</p>

<p>“We shall meet in Scotland by-and-by,
I believe,” said Loring pleasantly, as he
shook hands with Miss Pomeroy. “You
were to be at the Stewarts’, I believe, in
the last week of September, and so am I. I
shall look forward to it. Good-bye, Miss
Pomeroy.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye, Mr. Loring.”</p>

<p>A few minutes later Loring also took
leave of Lady Bracondale and went away.
The satisfaction was stronger than ever in
his eyes. Maud Pomeroy’s words had somehow
or other carried instantaneous conviction
to his mind, and in the fact he believed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">{142}</a></span>
them to contain he saw certain social ruin
for Julian Romayne.</p>

<p>“He’s done for himself all round,” he
said to himself as he let himself into his
rooms half an hour later. “That nice
little house in Chelsea will be to let next
season.”</p>

<p>At that same moment, in the manager’s
room at the offices of the Welcome Diamond
Mining Company, Julian Romayne was standing
by the table, looking down at Ramsay
as the latter sat leaning back in his chair,
indifferent enough in attitude, but with a
hard intensity of expression in his dull
eyes. Julian had evidently just risen,
pushing back his chair, the back of which
he was gripping almost convulsively. His
face was ashen, his eyes were dilated
with an expression of desperate, intolerable
temptation.</p>

<p>“I’ll do it,” he was saying in a harsh,
unnatural voice. “I’ll do it, Ramsay.
Shake hands on it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">{143}</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> cottage which Mrs. Romayne had
taken for August and September, on Julian’s
refusal to go abroad, was situated a few
miles above Henley. It was a very
charming little house, to which the term
“cottage” was applicable only in mock
humility; and it was very charmingly
situated. It had a delightful garden, not
large, but full of “roses, and sunflowers,
and all sorts of things,” as Mrs. Romayne
explained to Julian after her visit of inspection.
Its lawns sloped down to the
river, and altogether, on the same authority,
it was a wonderful chance to get hold of it.</p>

<p>The statement which Mrs. Romayne had
made to Lady Bracondale on Julian’s
authority, that there were “nice people
about,” had originated, as a matter of fact,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">{144}</a></span>
not with Julian, but with his mother herself.
It was quite true, nevertheless; but
apparently Julian’s sudden desire for quiet
had proved infectious. The acquaintance
between herself and her present neighbours
being of the slightest, Mrs. Romayne made
no such attempt as might have been expected
of her to develope that acquaintance.</p>

<p>She seemed to be strangely without
impetus in herself towards action of any
kind. She was “resting,” some people
might have said; she was pausing, certainly.
But whether, as the days went
on, her life did not signify rather temporary
and enforced quiescence, than the
peaceful and pleasant suspension of labour,
might have been an open question.</p>

<p>It was a hot, bright August; day after
day the sun shone steadily down, as Julian
departed for town after an early breakfast,
at which his mother never failed to appear.
Day after day it shone through all the
long, little-broken hours upon the quiet
house and garden, about which the one
woman’s figure moved in almost total
solitude, until, with the evening, Julian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">{145}</a></span>
returned again. Evening after evening
the mother and son spent alone, but by
no means always together. After their
dinner, during which conversation seldom
flagged between them, any more than it
would have flagged between two friendly
and well-bred acquaintances, Mrs. Romayne
would sit in the drawing-room with a bit
of fashionable fancy-work in her hand,
into which she only occasionally put a
stitch; and sometimes Julian would spend
half an hour with her there, reading the
newspaper and carrying on the talk of
dinner; or sometimes he would stroll out
into the garden at once, and come in only
just before bed-time.</p>

<p>Mrs. Romayne never followed him and
never questioned him. Perhaps it was the
curiously still life she led which brought so
strange and still an expression to her face;
a stillness which suggested a slow, wearing
waiting, and a mingled concentration, watchfulness,
and patience.</p>

<p>It was an evening in the second week of
September, and she was walking up and
down the lawn in the fading sunset light.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">{146}</a></span>
She was moving with slow, regular steps,
with the monotonous motion of a woman
to whom the even movement brought some
sort of relief or soothing. There was an
indescribable touch of desolateness about
her lonely figure as she moved up and
down before the empty house.</p>

<p>A servant came out to her by-and-by
with some newly-arrived letters. She took
them, and then, her monotonous motion
being perforce suspended, a sense of
physical fatigue seemed to assert itself,
and she sat down on a low basket-chair.</p>

<p>A sigh came from her as she did so, one
of those sighs which in their unconsciousness
are so suggestive of habitual suffering. She
paused a moment, looking away into space
with absent eyes. Then she seemed to
rouse herself, and took up one of the letters
as if forcing herself to seek relief from the
current of her monotonous thoughts. She
had opened the envelope and read the
letter half through in a mechanical, uninterested
way, when its contents seemed
suddenly to arrest her attention. A change
came to her expression, a change which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">{147}</a></span>
in its slight quickening and revival showed
how dulled, almost numbed, it had been
before.</p>

<p>She turned once more to the beginning
of the letter and read it again.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Glenfyle, Ross-shire.</span></p>

<p class="noindent">“<span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Romayne</span>,</p>

<p>“I am so sorry to have to ask you to
postpone the visit which you had promised
us for the end of this month. I find that
by some stupid mistake my husband and
I have given separate invitations for the
same date. As there is, unfortunately, no
doubt that his invitation was given first,
there falls upon me the very disagreeable
task of explaining the situation to you and
your son, and begging you to forgive me.</p>

<p class="center">“Yours truly,</p>

<p class="center">“<span class="smcap">Marion Stewart</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mrs. Romayne leant back in her chair,
not indolently, but with an intent consideration
in every line of her figure; and
letting the hand that held the letter fall
on her knee, she sat gazing at the written
words with sharp, angrily sparkling eyes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">{148}</a></span>
which looked as though they were bent on
piercing through the words themselves to
the meaning which she believed they hid.
She was evidently surprised and annoyed;
as evidently she gave not an instant’s
credence to the reason alleged for the postponement
of the visit in question; and the
slight involved in this postponement, indefinite,
as she noticed with an unpleasant little
smile, seemed to stimulate her.</p>

<p>Her face had grown even vindictive,
when her eyes fell on the postmark of the
second letter lying on her knee. It was that
of the same little Scotch town, the name of
which was stamped upon the already opened
envelope. She took it up eagerly, and as
she saw the handwriting, she paused for an
instant, and a flash of intense consideration
passed across her face. Then she tore it
hastily open. It was from Mrs. Pomeroy,
and it conveyed in three long-winded and
incoherent sheets a piece of news which
the writer was sure would delight Mrs.
Romayne.</p>

<p>“Dear Maud,” the letter said, was just
engaged to “that charming Mr. Loring.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">{149}</a></span>
Mrs. Pomeroy’s mind seemed to be in a
state of somewhat considerable confusion
between a theoretical and conventional
sense that it was very sad for her to lose
her daughter, and a certain practical and
actual sense, which by no means harmonised
with the theoretical one, and all unconsciously
threw a good deal of light on the relations
between the mother and daughter, as they
actually existed. The coherence of the letter
was further disturbed by sundry sentences,
which dovetailed so oddly into the general
fabric that they had somewhat the appearance
of being inserted to order; sentences which
conveyed various repetitions of “dear Maud’s”
assurance of Mrs. Romayne’s congratulations;
and various repetitions of the statement
that Mr. Loring’s financial position had
recently improved amazingly, and that he
was sure of a seat in Parliament at the
forthcoming general election.</p>

<p>“He has been staying with the Stewarts
during the whole of our visit to them,” the
letter ended. “Dear Lady Marion has
been so kind about it, and taken such an
interest.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">{150}</a></span></p>

<p>“Ah!”</p>

<p>The exclamation, uttered, evidently involuntarily,
just above her breath, came from
Mrs. Romayne’s lips sharply and bitterly.
She had read the letter through with certain
quick movements of her eyebrows, and
mocking smiles coming and going about her
thin lips, and they smiled again as she folded
the letter deliberately and put it back into
its envelope. She was looking thoroughly
roused now, and there was a confidence in
her alert, determined expression. It was
the kindling up of martial spirit at a
challenging trumpet-call from a well-known
battlefield.</p>

<p>If Marston Loring and his future wife
were indeed arranging their forces for the
undermining of Mrs. Romayne’s social position&mdash;and
Miss Pomeroy and Loring between
them could have pieced out a very sufficient
explanation of Lady Marion Stewart’s note&mdash;the
campaign, judging from appearances at
that moment, was likely to be far from a tame
one.</p>

<p>Mrs. Romayne was still sitting with the
letters in her hand, tapping one foot with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">{151}</a></span>
impatient vigour upon the grass, and there
was the same eager intentness in her eyes,
when from the house behind her the sound
of a dinner-bell rang out. She started
violently, and in the start something seemed
to fall between her and the subject on which
her thoughts had been busy. A curious shade
of that new stillness replaced the energy on
her face. It was the dressing-bell, and she
rose mechanically; and as she turned towards
the house her eyes fell upon the figure of
Julian. He had evidently been standing on
the verandah, and as she rose he had turned,
and was disappearing into the house.
Another shade of stillness fell upon her face,
as though the letters she had received, and
the feelings they had stirred, had receded into
the distance.</p>

<p>It often happened that the mother and
son did not meet, on Julian’s return home
in the evening, until dinner-time, and it
happened so this evening. The dinner-bell
was ringing when Julian came downstairs
with a quick word or two of apology, and
followed his mother into the dining-room.</p>

<p>Julian looked as though his month’s hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">{152}</a></span>
work had by no means agreed with him.
His face was even painfully thin and worn,
and there was an expression of hard concentration
about it which seemed to age it
strangely. His eyes were rather sunken. It
was a curious feature of a change in him less
easily defined, that his likeness to his mother
had faded considerably. All the character of
his face now seemed to originate about his
mouth; that mouth of which Mrs. Romayne
had been wont to say with affected gaiety
that it was like nobody in particular; that
mouth which had been a somewhat weak and
undecided feature. There was nothing undecided
about it now, and Mrs. Romayne
never looked at it without a deepening of
that stillness on her face. It was set into
heavy, resolute lines.</p>

<p>No one, indeed, judging from the bare
outline of Julian’s daily life during that hot
August, could have wondered at the signs of
physical wear and tear that he exhibited.
Ten o’clock, on every one of those sultry days,
found him at work, not indeed in the Temple,
but in an office in the City; and it was from
the same office that he would issue forth at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">{153}</a></span>
about five o’clock to catch the train for
Henley, sometimes with sullen determination,
sometimes with a pale, fierce excitement on
his face.</p>

<p>The affairs of the Welcome Diamond Mining
Company had readjusted themselves, after
the blow which had threatened the company’s
very existence, as hardly the most sanguine
could have hoped. Ten days after the
announcement of the presence of water in the
mine, some of the newspapers published
another telegram which had been received by
the directors. The passage of the water, by
which the existing mine was rendered
practically useless, had revealed hitherto unsuspected
possibilities, and there appeared
to be little doubt that the first mine had
been, as it were, only a pledge of
still richer strata yet to be worked. One
telegram followed another, confirming the
report in greater detail. Prospectuses were
issued, setting forth a proposal to utilise the
opportunity thus opened, and debentures were
issued for the providing of the necessary funds.
These debentures were taken up somewhat
slowly at first, but on the arrival in England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">{154}</a></span>
of specimens of diamonds from the new lead,
together with a circumstantial report, they
were taken up with a rush. Works were
understood to be already on foot, and
dividends were looked for at an early date.
The new managing director of the company
was Julian Romayne.</p>

<p>There was a kind of dry excitement about
him to-night behind the deliberate assumption
of conversational interest which was his never-changing
manner with his mother now, and
his hand shook a little as he poured himself
out more wine than usual.</p>

<p>He did not rejoin his mother in the
drawing-room, saying something as she left
him about having letters to write; and two
hours afterwards he was walking up and
down the lawn in the moonlight with a
cigar.</p>

<p>There was a fierce restlessness in his step,
and there was a fierce restlessness in his face,
too. He had been walking there for half an
hour when a shadow passed across the blind
of the drawing-room window&mdash;the night was
very hot and the window was wide open&mdash;and
the blind was drawn up. Mrs. Romayne’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">{155}</a></span>
figure stood there outlined by the lamplight
within. The drawing-room window was
shadowed from the moonlight by an angle of
the house.</p>

<p>“Good night, Julian!” she called.</p>

<p>Julian stopped in his walk mechanically.</p>

<p>“Good night, mother!” he answered.
The figure in the window seemed to hesitate
for a moment; then Mrs. Romayne moved
and drew down the blind, the lights in the
room behind went out one by one, and Julian
resumed his walk in the moonlight as
mechanically as he had stopped it.</p>

<p>It was his custom to go, every morning,
first to his room in the Temple in case any
letters might be waiting for him there; and
on the following morning, a slight accident
on the line having considerably delayed his
train, he paused a moment before giving his
order to the cabman. He was very late, and
there was a feverish impatience in every line
of his face. He had almost decided that any
private letters might wait until the next day,
when, with a sudden, unaccountable reaction,
he sprang into the cab and told the man to
drive to the Temple.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">{156}</a></span></p>

<p>He had apparently repented of the
resolution by the time the cab stopped, for he
sprang out with a muttered imprecation on
the delay. There was only one letter waiting
for him, and he caught it up fiercely. Then
the handwriting in which it was directed
caught his eye.</p>

<p>All the tumultuous heat and impatience of
his face died out suddenly and utterly. He
stood for a moment staring down at the letter,
white to the very lips. Then he seemed
absolutely and physically to set his teeth, and
in the intense hardness of determination
which set its mark on every muscle of his
face, his whole expression would have seemed
to deteriorate, markedly and terribly, but for
the desperation in his eyes which was little
short of agony.</p>

<p>He moved abruptly, crossed the room,
unlocked a drawer in his writing-table, and
thrust the letter in with quick, deliberate
movements, unopened. He locked the drawer
again sharply, and turned and went hastily
out of the room.</p>

<p>The letter was from Clemence; it was the
first sign of her existence which he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">{157}</a></span>
received since their parting on that June
evening nearly three months ago.</p>

<p>He was looking only older, harder, and
more recklessly resolute when about a quarter
of an hour later he entered the office of the
Welcome Diamond Mining Company. The
feeble-looking little messenger was in solitary
possession, and he looked up rather uneasily
as Julian wished him a brief good morning
and crossed to the door of the manager’s
room.</p>

<p>“Mr. Ramsay’s just gone out, Mr. Romayne,”
he said. “I was to say he would
be in again directly.”</p>

<p>Julian made a curt gesture of assent and
went on into the private room. There was
plenty of work waiting for him, it appeared,
and he was still applying himself to it with
dogged concentration, when, nearly an hour
later, the door opened and Ramsay appeared.</p>

<p>“There you are!” he said indifferently.
“I thought you weren’t going to turn up this
morning.”</p>

<p>Julian had just glanced up from the letter
he was writing to acknowledge the other
man’s entrance, and he went on writing as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">{158}</a></span>
he explained briefly that his train had been
delayed.</p>

<p>“No particular reason for wanting me, I
suppose?” he said in a brief, businesslike
way, as he laid down his pen.</p>

<p>Ramsay sat down deliberately, and put
his hand into the breast-pocket of his coat.</p>

<p>“Well, yes,” he said. “There’s a matter
here which rather calls for the attention of
the managing director.”</p>

<p>He held out a letter as he spoke, and
Julian took it and read it quickly. Then he
laid it down on the table before him, and
looked up slowly at Ramsay. His face was
rather pale.</p>

<p>“A general meeting of shareholders!” he
said. “Demanded!”</p>

<p>There was a moment’s pause, while he
looked steadily into Ramsay’s immoveable
face, and then he added in the same rather
difficult tone:</p>

<p>“Did you expect this, Ramsay?”</p>

<p>“I never expect,” returned Ramsay drily.
“Such a thing was on the cards, of course.”</p>

<p>Julian’s face grew dark and calculating.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said harshly, after another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">{159}</a></span>
moment’s pause, “it must be arranged for, of
course. What do you propose?”</p>

<p>Ramsay answered the question by another.</p>

<p>“Do you happen to know anything,” he
said, “of a man named Compton&mdash;Howard
Compton?”</p>

<p>Julian’s brows contracted as if with an
involuntary effort to detect the relevancy
of the question as he answered tersely:</p>

<p>“Yes. He and I belong to the same
club.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t know, I suppose, that some
shares in the Welcome have drifted into
his hands?”</p>

<p>Julian shook his head with a quick frown
of vexation.</p>

<p>“Ah!” observed Ramsay; “they have,
though. And it has come to my knowledge
that various enquiries have been made into
the state of the Welcome Diamond Mine;
made on the spot, and made in secret.
And I’ve traced these enquiries to this Mr.
Howard Compton.”</p>

<p>A dreadful grey pallor had begun to
spread itself over Julian’s face, and the
muscles seemed to have grown rigid with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">{160}</a></span>
the intense force with which he held them
to their expression of dogged determination.
He did not speak, and Ramsay went on
in the same dry, indifferent way:</p>

<p>“He is either a very clever hand, or
very cleverly advised. The one point we
score, at present, is that he has not done as he
intended to do, and taken us by surprise.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The words seemed to come from between
Julian’s dry, white lips almost without consciousness
on his part. His eyes were fixed
upon Ramsay with a hard, unseeing kind
of stare, his voice was hoarse, uneven, and
hardly audible, and it died away, leaving
the sentence unfinished.</p>

<p>“The meaning is obvious, of course,”
returned Ramsay. “An affair of this kind
is a ticklish thing to pull off, and a hitch
of this kind is always possible, though I
never came across an affair in which it
seemed less probable. I don’t know yet
exactly how much our friend knows. The
meeting won’t be a particularly placid affair,
of course, and you’re likely to have a warm
time of it. But, of course, there’s a chance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">{161}</a></span>
that he mayn’t know quite enough, and we
may be able to pull it through, yet.”</p>

<p>“And if not?”</p>

<p>Something seemed to rattle in Julian’s
throat as he spoke the words, and they
came out thick and husky.</p>

<p>“If not?” repeated Ramsay. “Well, if
not, I think I wouldn’t go to that meeting
if I were you.”</p>

<p>There was a moment’s dead silence,
broken only by Julian’s heavy, laboured
breathing. The two men sat there face to
face, and their eyes met with a terrible
significance of what was better unexpressed
in words. Then Ramsay’s dull eyes took
a deliberate survey of Julian’s face. It was
drawn and livid, and the elder man rose
and took from the cupboard some brandy.
He poured it into a glass with a slightly
contemptuous smile, and put it into Julian’s
hand.</p>

<p>“You’re the very devil to work,” he
said drily. “And for all I know you may
be first-rate as a winner; but I can’t say
you’re a good loser. And it’s a useful lesson
to learn in this business.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">{162}</a></span></p>

<p>Julian drank the brandy and rose
mechanically. The strong stimulant hardly
seemed to touch the blanched horror of his
face.</p>

<p>“What do you propose to do?” he said
in a stiff, toneless voice.</p>

<p>“Personally, nothing,” returned Ramsay,
“until I know more. Business will go on
as usual. You’ll call the meeting, of course.
I’ll tell Harrison to get the forms ready
for you to sign. They must be sent out
to-morrow. Going?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Julian heavily. “There’s
nothing more I need do to-day.”</p>

<p>He took his hat and went slowly out
of the office, looking straight before him
like a man walking in his sleep. Ramsay
looked after him, and stood for a minute
rubbing his chin thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Not quite what I thought he was,”
he said to himself; “though he has served
this purpose well enough. Pity he hasn’t
a little more of his father in him. Got
all the makings of the right sort, but he
can’t stay.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">{163}</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> early sunlight of a lovely September
morning was streaming into the room through
every crack and chink in the blinds and
curtains, making the light from the still
burning lamp look yellow, dim, and unnatural.
It was Julian’s sitting-room in the house in
Chelsea, and the light, falling here and there,
touched into distinctness many of those little
luxurious details on which the evening light
had fallen on that winter day eighteen months
before, when Mrs. Romayne had stood upon
the threshold and looked round upon her
completed arrangements, waiting then for the
use which was to give them life. On a chair
by the writing-table, his head dropped sideways
on his arm as it rested on the table,
sat Julian Romayne asleep.</p>

<p>He was asleep, but he was not at rest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">{164}</a></span>
His face was grey and drawn; it twitched
painfully, and his hand was fiercely clenched.
Gradually an expression of terror and despair
gathered on his features, until they were
almost convulsed, and with a strangled,
gasping cry he woke and started to his feet,
trembling in every limb, and with great drops
standing on his forehead. He stood clutching
at a chair for support, while the first poignant
impression of his dream subsided, and then
he moved as though impelled by some reactionary
impulse to collect himself. He
glanced at the clock and saw that the hands
pointed to a quarter past six. He was vaguely
conscious of having heard it strike six, so
that he could have slept for a few moments
only. His lips twitched slightly at the
thought of what those few moments had held
for him. Then he realised that he was cold,
that all his limbs were stiff and aching, and
he dragged himself slowly across the room,
drew the curtains and the blinds, and stood
there in the sunshine.</p>

<p>It was the first movement of physical
consciousness which he had felt since he left
the office of the Welcome Diamond Mining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">{165}</a></span>
Company on the morning of the previous
day.</p>

<p>How that day had passed he did not
know. Here and there in the blackness a
picture of himself stood out with uncertain
distinctness. He knew that he had telegraphed
to his mother to the effect that he
might not return to Henley for some time.
He remembered writing the words though
he could recall no mental process by which
the elaborate excuse he had made had occurred
to him. He knew that somewhere dinner had
been placed before him, though where, and
whether he had eaten, he knew not at all.
For the rest, an impression of ceaseless
walking, of interminable streets giving place
imperceptibly to the four walls of his own
room, made up the only actual background
in his memory to the intense mental consciousness
which had usurped for the time
being the tangibility of material things.</p>

<p>The favourable turn in the affairs of the
Welcome Diamond Mining Company had been
founded on a deliberate system of forgery
and fraud, planned by Ramsay, subscribed to
and participated in by Julian. The telegram<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">{166}</a></span>
as to the new lead had been concocted in
the office in the City; the diamonds exhibited
as earnest of the future yield of the mine had
been bought for that purpose; and not one
penny of the money paid in debentures had
ever been intended for application to the
working of the ruined mine. If these facts
should come to light&mdash;and hostile enquiries
once instituted on the spot, only one of those
incredibly lucky chances to which gamblers
and swindlers alike owe so much could avert
such a catastrophe&mdash;the consequences were
obvious. Public exposure, public ignominy
and execration, wholesale and irremediable
loss of position, were absolutely inevitable.
And as inevitable if he remained in England,
the dark gulf in which his life must be
swallowed up and closed&mdash;as far as everything
which constituted life for him was concerned&mdash;whether
he fled from it or whether it
clutched him, was the legitimate reward of his
doings; penal servitude.</p>

<p>He could not realise it. He could not
face it. He had beaten it back, he had thrust
it down again and again during that long day
and night, and again and again the horror had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">{167}</a></span>
swept over him, gaining always in certainty
and reality. Struggle against it as he might
and did, clutching at his consciousness, shaking
and rending it with a force not to be resisted,
and growing ever stronger and stronger, there
dawned a dazed, bewildered conviction that
the end he saw before him was indeed the
inevitable end; that in that black gulf, and
no other, all his efforts and fierce strivings
were to find their consummation.</p>

<p>He had digged it with his own hands; he
had followed on towards it in a very desperation
of defiance and recklessness, goaded by a
grinding sense of failure and frustration to a
wild daring which had looked like courage and
resolution. But the spirit which had stimulated
him was not in himself. All unconscious
of it as he was, he had been drunk with the
thought of what lay beyond that gulf; drunk
with a desperate, unreasoning anticipation of
triumph. The hideous possibility of failure
confronted him now practically for the first
time, and before it all his fictitious stamina
shrivelled away, as in its very nature it was
bound to do. A vague, confounded comprehension
of the consequences which he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">{168}</a></span>
brought upon himself rose upon him, walling
him in on every side; and about those consequences,
as connected with himself, there
was all the ghastly incongruity and unreality
of a hideous nightmare. He had never understood
the realities of life. He had crushed
down their impulses in his heart. He had
called superficialities essentials; selfish ignorance,
practical sense; and he had worked
and fought in a false atmosphere, and for a
false aim.</p>

<p>And now, instead of that fictitious triumph
which he had looked to grasp, he found himself
face to face with facts so sordid and so
relentless that he could hardly recognise them
as facts at all. His world was tottering into
ruins all about him; the clash and crisis of
imminent downfall and disgrace was stunning
him and shaking him through and through;
and in the wild tumult and confusion all the
limitations of his nature seemed to break up,
as it were, into one blind chaos of protest
and repudiation, dominated only by despair.
Nothing fixed or steadfast held its place.
The very passions by which he had been
driven on had been borne down and numbed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">{169}</a></span>
The thought of Clemence had become merely
a vague element in the confusion. Of his
mother he did not think at all. Even that
dark factor in his being&mdash;the perversion of
his instincts as to truth and falsehood, honesty
and dishonesty&mdash;which had asserted its grim
presence with the very awakening of his
character; which had dictated the first steps
along the path of which he stood now at the
end; was swept into solution, now, with every
other element in his character. It had held
its place, hitherto, side by side with the other
motive powers by which his life had been
regulated; dictating the lines on which those
powers should work, strengthening and developing
with the demands they put upon
it. But it had remained the servant of a
stronger passion, and as far as any power
of support or guidance was concerned it had
gone down in the flood. He had no perception,
truly, of the moral aspect of his position,
no sense of guilt or of remorse. He only
knew that he was beaten, that it was all
over with him.</p>

<p>He stood there at the window staring
out into the sunshine, seeing nothing, conscious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">{170}</a></span>
of nothing but the gulf before him;
as utterly and absolutely isolated in his misery
as though he had been the only creature
living in the world. The desperate struggle
with facts was sinking into a hopeless confused
acceptance of them; into a dazed, bewildered
contemplation of details which seemed to rise
slowly into distinctness out of the fog which
hung about them; to rise and fade again
without volition on his part. Details connected
with the future came first, and he
looked at them and understood them with
stunned composure as though they stood outside
him all together. Then he found himself
wondering heavily as to the time that must
pass before the certainty that was in himself
became literal knowledge. There was no
sense of any possible chance of salvation in
his mind.</p>

<p>By-and-by he became heavily and confusedly
aware that another day had begun;
another day through which he must carry his
horrible, bewildering burden&mdash;no longer in
the semi-unconsciousness of yesterday, but
alive now in every fibre to its intolerable
pressure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">{171}</a></span></p>

<p>He went out into the sunshine by-and-by,
out into the streets he knew so well; and as
he walked along there came upon him a ghastly
sense of being but a shadow among shadows.
The life about him seemed to have receded to
an incalculable distance, to have lost all substance.
He himself, as he appeared to other
people, had no existence; and his real self had
no existence for any one but himself. He
was face to face with black, implacable
reality, and before its presence all the superficialities
and conventionalities which had
usurped its place vanished like the shades they
were.</p>

<p>He walked, always with that chill sense of
isolation on him, from Chelsea to the City; in
motion, in continual motion only, was his
misery endurable. Ramsay was not at the
office when he arrived, and a message from
him, left with the secretary, informed Julian
that he would not be there that day. His
absence affected Julian not at all. There was
no suspense in his mental attitude to make
him crave for even a blow to end it. To his
battered consciousness delay before the final
agony had something of the appearance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">{172}</a></span>
rest or respite. He did the work he had come
to do with a numbed comprehension of its
import, and then as he passed out again into
those horribly unreal streets there came upon
him a desperate longing for human companionship;
a desperate longing to break through
his solitude and touch another human creature.
He would go to the club, he thought dully.
He must speak to some one; he must
get some assurance of his own identity,
or its unfamiliarity would drive him mad.</p>

<p>There were two or three men only who
were known to him in the room when he
arrived, and even as they greeted him they
seemed to elude him; to retreat and to lose
all tangibility beyond the yawning gulf which
lay between himself and them. He tried to
talk, he tried desperately to bridge the gulf.
In vain. He turned away and went out into
the streets again, alone with the one terrible
reality which the world seemed to contain.</p>

<p>The failure broke him down. An unendurable
horror of himself and of the world; a
very terror of his misery; rolled down upon
him and overwhelmed him. It was one of
those realisations of the impotency of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">{173}</a></span>
humanity before the strokes of the infinitely
greater than humanity which seize upon a
man sometimes when all the wrappings of life
and custom are stripped from him, and he
finds himself in primeval defencelessness. He
could only fight wildly with it. Those
instincts and affinities through which such
moments work out strength and comprehension
were utterly submerged in him, now;
the experience could be for him nothing but a
blind horror, giving place at last to the old
stunned, hopeless confusion and despair. And
when at last he dragged himself upstairs to
his room in the Temple late at night he was
utterly exhausted, mentally and physically.
He dropped into a chair and sank into a heavy
sleep.</p>

<p>Ten days followed; ten long days giving
place to heavy nights; ten nights passing
into monotonous days. By degrees Julian
fell into a species of dull routine, in which he
ate and drank, and even slept; passed to and
fro along the London streets; stunned almost
to stupefaction. He went each day to the
office and sat there all day long doing little;
sitting, for the most part, staring into space<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">{174}</a></span>
or walking up and down with heavy, regular
steps. He was rarely disturbed. Ramsay
appeared but seldom; his visits were brief,
and he was uncommunicative.</p>

<p>At last there came a morning when
he reached the office to find upon his
desk a letter in Ramsay’s familiar handwriting.</p>

<p>Julian sat down before it and looked at it
for a moment, his face twitching slightly.
Then he broke the seal.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">“<span class="smcap">Dear Romayne</span>,” he read,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Your friend, Compton, holds the
whole affair in his hand. Marston Loring
gave him the tip. You will do as you
think best about meeting the shareholders.
I shall not be present myself, as I am leaving
England, for the present, to-night.</p>

<p class="center">“Yours,</p>

<p class="center">“<span class="smcap">Alfred Ramsay</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p>The letter bore date of the previous
day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">{175}</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">A white</span> face, drawn and set into a look which
pitifully travestied the calmness of despair;
bloodshot eyes with something in them of the
incomprehending agony of a hunted animal;
quivering lips which would not take the rigid
line at which they aimed, and from which
seemed to radiate an indescribable suggestion of
youthfulness, which made the bewildered desperation
of the face infinitely piteous. Two
hours had passed, and Julian was seated at his
writing-table in his room at the Temple. He
held a pen in his hand, and before him lay a
sheet of paper bearing three words only, “My
dear Clemence.” On the table behind him lay
a roughly packed travelling-bag and a “Bradshaw.”</p>

<p>Flight, instant flight, was the one course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">{176}</a></span>
that had occurred to him. Such a necessity
had been present to him from the
first, and in the almost insane terror which
had mastered him on finding himself deserted
by Ramsay, thoughts which had lain dormant
in his mind during the last ten days
had taken shape almost without volition
on his part, and he had made his plans with
wild haste. He knew nothing, he thought
of nothing but that he must go at once, that at
any moment he might find himself stopped, at
any moment it might be too late!</p>

<p>No thought of that last refuge of the
detected criminal, suicide, presented itself to
him. The realities of life were as yet strange
to him; wrenched from his moorings, tossed
away to drift on the pitiless sea, he could not
realise what was the depth of that sea, how
futile must be his struggles to keep himself
afloat. The reality of death had never touched
his superficial nature.</p>

<p>He made his preparations with the
promptitude of desperation, and as each detail
was despatched, one deed that must be done
began to prick into his consciousness. Some
word must be sent to Clemence. With this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">{177}</a></span>
necessity he found himself at last confronted
with no further possibility of postponement.</p>

<p>But no words would come to him. Little
as he understood it, all the bewildered misery
of his heart was what he wanted to convey
to her; all the incoherent horror which was
tossing him to and fro. What words were
possible where there was no reason, only blind,
agonised feeling? There was one aspect of
his shipwreck now in which it appeared only as
the end and consummation of his ten weeks of
silence towards Clemence; those ten weeks in
which he saw, now, only cruelty and futility
where he had seen before wisdom and
necessity. His failure, his ruin, had a side on
which they touched him only in his connection
with her; it became the failure to keep the
promise he had made her when he saw her
last; the ruin of his vision of a life with her.
He sat there, staring stupidly at the paper,
and gradually all thoughts slipped away from
him but the thought of Clemence herself. A
hunger, such as his selfish young heart had
never known, rose in him for her presence,
her pity. His misery turned to her, stretching
forth empty, despairing hands, until the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">{178}</a></span>
sick longing dominated his whole consciousness.</p>

<p>Then out of the aching yearning there
came to him suddenly a recollection of the
letter he had received ten days before; the
letter which he had thrust into a drawer, in his
blind, foolhardy determination, unopened.
The end on which he had set himself to wait
had vanished for ever. Everything by which
he had held was overturned and submerged.
But the letter was there still. The letter had
come from Clemence.</p>

<p>He unlocked with trembling eagerness the
drawer in which he had placed it, drew out
the envelope and tore it open. That it could
bring no comfort to him, that there could,
indeed, be only aggravation of his wretchedness
in it, was as nothing to him. It was to
touch Clemence that he wanted; Clemence,
and Clemence only was the cry of his whole
being. The letter was very short, a few lines
only. He ran his eyes over it with
hungry avidity, and then they seemed to stop
suddenly, and all the quivering life seemed to
freeze on his features. A moment passed and
a great, dry sob broke from him; he dashed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">{179}</a></span>
his head down upon the table with a bitter
boyish cry:</p>

<p>“Clemmie! Clemmie!”</p>

<p>Simple, beautiful with that wonderful new
tenderness which comes to a woman with the
consummation of her womanhood, pathetic in
their gentleness beyond all words, the few
brief lines brought him from Clemence the
most sacred tidings that can pass between
husband and wife, tidings of the birth of their
child.</p>

<p>“Clemmie!”</p>

<p>The word broke from him again, a pitiful,
despairing sob, and then he lay there, long,
dry sobs shaking him from head to foot as that
bitterest of all waves, the unavailing realisation
of what might have been contrasted with what
is, swept over him and overwhelmed him.
The reality, touched into life by her letter as
though Clemence’s voice had spoken to him,
which he had thrown away; the reality on
which, in doing so, he had hurled himself;
stood out before him in pitiless distinctness;
and in his ignorance and blindness, in his
utter want of comprehension of the moral
aspect of his acts and the stern justice of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">{180}</a></span>
retribution he was meeting, there was no light
or cohesion for him anywhere in the world,
and darkness and chaos had closed about
him.</p>

<p>Nearly an hour passed before he moved,
and lifted a white, haggard face, marred with
the agony of impotent regret. He looked
about him vaguely, pushing his hair back
heavily from his forehead, and as his eye
fell upon the travelling-bag that instinctive
sense of the necessity upon him, which had
stirred him with no consciousness on his part,
deepened into a mechanically active impulse.
He must go. He paused a moment, and then
he drew out a fresh sheet of paper.</p>

<p>“Falconer!” he muttered. “Falconer
will see to them. There’s no one else!”</p>

<p>It was as though the fire through which
he was passing had burnt away from him
all recollection, even, of his mother. He had
thought of her for long only as the source of
all that was unpleasant in his life. Now in
the sharpness of his pain a haze had spread
itself over the past, and all thought of the
means by which the present position had been
brought about was obliterated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">{181}</a></span></p>

<p>He wrote for a few minutes, rapidly, desperately,
in a handwriting which was hardly
legible; then he thrust the letter into an
envelope, which he directed to Dennis Falconer;
and rose. His original intention of
writing to Clemence had left him. It had
become an impossibility. And side by side
with his sense of his utter incapacity to find
any words in which to speak to her, there
had risen in him a heart-broken impulse to
see her face once more and for the last time.</p>

<p>The sunshine of the day had given place
to a drizzling rain when he turned into that
quiet little street which had witnessed their
last meeting. The dazed sense of the necessity
for flight was strong upon him. Darkness
had fallen; he had left his room for the last
time; in another hour he would be in the
Liverpool train, a fugitive from justice; and
in the terror and confusion of the realisation
of that one all-absorbing fact, the only other
thought that lived in him was his blind
desire for one sight of Clemence. He had
come to the little street unreasoningly, weighing
no probabilities as to whether or no she
would be at work; not even understanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">{182}</a></span>
that there were probabilities to weigh; coming
there simply because he had seen her there
before and knew of no other chance of seeing
her. He took up his position in a doorway
by which she must pass, and waited. It
seemed to him that he had been standing
there, utterly alone, for hours, when the door,
from which his haggard, sunken eyes had
never stirred, opened.</p>

<p>As on that other occasion Clemence was
the last to come out, but she came this time
walking quickly and eagerly. For an instant
as she passed beneath the lamp the light fell
on her face, and as Julian’s eyes rested on
it for that instant, he clutched at the railing
by which he stood. Then she came on in
the shadow, still followed by those hungry
eyes.</p>

<p>Perhaps she felt their gaze. Perhaps her
own heart felt the pang that was rending
his. In the very act of passing him she
stopped suddenly and turned towards him,
looking into the dimness in which he was
shrouded. She stretched out her hands with
a low, inarticulate cry.</p>

<p>He had her in his arms in an instant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">{183}</a></span>
straining her to him with a despairing passion
which he had never known before, and she
clung to him half frightened by his touch.</p>

<p>“Julian!” she whispered. Then as no
word came from him, only his burning kisses
pressed upon her upturned face, she went on
softly: “Dear, weren’t you going to speak
to me?” Still he did not speak, and with
a look and accent indescribably beautiful in
their tender womanliness, she said: “You
didn’t think I would reproach you?”</p>

<p>“It’s good-bye, Clemmie,” he muttered
hoarsely. “Good-bye! I&mdash;I’m going away
for&mdash;for a little while.”</p>

<p>He could as easily have killed her, at that
moment, as have told her the truth.</p>

<p>“Going away!” she echoed, with a little
catch in her breath. “Where, dear?”</p>

<p>“To&mdash;to America.” He could not tell
her all the truth, but there was no power
in him to originate an unnecessary lie. He
felt her arms tighten about him, and he
answered the appeal hoarsely, hurrying out
the words. “I&mdash;I’m leaving a letter about
you, and&mdash;&mdash;” his voice died away in his
throat as he tried to speak of his child, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">{184}</a></span>
then he went on rapidly and unevenly: “It
will be&mdash;all right. Clemence! Clemence! try
to forgive me. Good-bye, dear, good-bye!”</p>

<p>He drew her hands from about his neck,
kissing them wildly. Her hold tightened
instinctively upon his fingers, and she was
trembling very much.</p>

<p>“You’re not going&mdash;now?” she whispered.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered hoarsely. “Now!”</p>

<p>Then, as he saw the look which came over
her face, the desperate necessity for reassuring
her came upon him. He tried to smile.</p>

<p>“America is nothing nowadays, you know,”
he said in a harsh, unnatural tone. “It’s no
distance. I shall be&mdash;back directly. Say
good-bye to me, won’t you? I must go.”</p>

<p>She let her face fall on his shoulder,
pressing it closer and closer, as though she
could never tear herself away.</p>

<p>“I’m frightened for you, dear,” she said.
“I’m frightened. Are you sure, sure, there
is nothing&mdash;wrong?”</p>

<p>“Quite sure&mdash;of course.”</p>

<p>“You will be back soon?”</p>

<p>“Quite soon.”</p>

<p>There was a moment’s quivering silence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">{185}</a></span>
and then Clemence slowly lifted her face.
He took her in his arms again, and their
lips met in one long agonised kiss. Neither
spoke again. When he released her, Julian,
with a face like death, turned and went away
down the street, his head bent, his whole
figure tense as though he were facing a
blinding wind. Clemence stood for a moment
still as a statue, her eyes wide, her face quite
quiet. Then she too went away through the
night.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Over</span> the country about Henley, that same
day, the sun was shining gloriously.</p>

<p>It was about five o’clock in the afternoon,
and there was a clearness about the light,
a distinctness about the shadows, which, taken
in conjunction with the heavy bank of clouds
into which the sun would presently sink,
argued coming rain. For the present, however,
nature was lovely to look at; and
a garden-party which was going on in the
large, old-fashioned garden of a large, old-fashioned
country house, about a mile from
the river, had the benefit of every advantage
which atmosphere and surroundings could
give.</p>

<p>It was a large party, and the scene was
very bright and animated. On the larger
of the two lawns, conspicuous among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">{187}</a></span>
well-dressed but by no means striking-looking
women about her, stood Mrs.
Romayne, talking to a local magnate.</p>

<p>She had arrived about half an hour
before, and the politely concealed satisfaction
and surprise with which she had been received
had testified to the fact that her
appearance at such a function was a phenomenon
in the neighbourhood. Invitations
had showered in on her during her residence
at the “cottage,” but it had gradually become
an established fact that she was “going
out very little.” This was in truth the first
party she had attended. It was fortunate
that her hostess was not a particularly
observant person. There had been something
about Mrs. Romayne when she arrived
which might have dashed that hostess’s
personal elation with a suspicion that her
guest’s appearance had been dictated by
motives not wholly complimentary to the
party; lines about the mouth which suggested
the enforced endurance of a burden
from which she was seeking temporary
relief, however fictitious; a restlessness in
the eyes which suggested an attempt at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">{188}</a></span>
the eluding of the too insistent companionship
of her own thoughts.</p>

<p>Her eyes were painfully bright, and
there was a nervous tension about her
manner as she stood there on the lawn,
talking and laughing. But her companion
of the moment&mdash;a worthy old gentleman,
with not much acquaintance among women
of the world&mdash;thought her simply the most
astonishingly charming woman he had ever
met; and seeking in his mind for lines on
which to make himself agreeable to her,
he recollected to have heard something
about her son.</p>

<p>“You have a son here, I believe?” he
said, with ponderous interest. “I should
greatly like to make his acquaintance.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Romayne laughed.</p>

<p>“I have a son,” she said, “but he is
not here, I’m sorry to say. He is hard at
work just at present. Ah!” she broke off
with an exclamation of surprise. “I see
a friend of mine over there! I must go
and speak to her.” And with a bow and
a smile to her admirer, she broke off the conversation
which had, perhaps, seemed longer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">{189}</a></span>
to one party than to the other, and moved
across the lawn to where Hilda Compton
was standing watching her with an uncertain
but not particularly pleasant expression on
her pretty face.</p>

<p>“Are you staying in the neighbourhood?”
said Mrs. Romayne prettily, when they had
shaken hands. She was apparently entirely
oblivious of something cold and disagreeable
in the younger woman’s manner. “Is your
husband here?”</p>

<p>Hilda Compton glanced at her with a
certain tentative triumph in her eyes.</p>

<p>“No!” she said. “He’s not here. I’m
staying on a house-boat, but he is kept in
town over some troublesome business!”</p>

<p>She paused, and then, as Mrs. Romayne
made a rather patronising gesture of sympathy,
that gleam of triumph strengthened
into something distinctly malicious. Hilda
Compton had never forgotten or forgiven
that moment in the Norfolk garden twelve
months ago. It had been no part of her
policy to resent it when such resentment
must necessarily have rebounded to her
own disadvantage; she had accepted Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">{190}</a></span>
Romayne’s society friendliness during the
past season with just such a manner as
might sting but could not, in very self-respect,
be impugned by the elder woman;
a manner cleverly tinged with that deference
which points the sense of superiority with
which a certain type of girl recognises the
fact that the present is to her, and not
to the previous generation. But she had
hoped always that the day might come
when she would find herself in a position
to take more active measures, and she felt,
now, that even what she knew to be a slight
breach of conjugal faith would be venial, if
it would straighten what she would have
called her “score” against Julian Romayne’s
mother.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s rather a bore!” she said.
“City business, you know! Don’t you
think it’s very foolish of men to speculate,
Mrs. Romayne? Of course I haven’t a
quarter of your experience, but I think so.
They always seem to get into trouble of
some sort! But you know more than I
do about this affair, no doubt, since Mr.
Romayne is mixed up in it, and he’s such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">{191}</a></span>
a devoted son. Husbands don’t tell one
much, I find!”</p>

<p>Self-command is a wonderful thing, even
when it originates in no higher motive
than the instinct of a woman of the world
for the retention of her society demeanour.
Mrs. Romayne’s lips were ashen and her
fingers were clenched round the sunshade
she held until her rings cut into them, but
she faced Hilda Compton steadily, and
with a mechanical smile, her eyes, a little
dull and contracted, meeting the girl’s
pretty, unfeeling ones. Hilda Compton
noticed the change of colour even behind
the artificial tinting, and rejoiced at the
slip of the tongue by which her foolish
young husband had put such a weapon
into her hand. If only she had succeeded
in making Howard tell her more, instead
of making him lose his temper! She reflected,
however, that perhaps the truth
was not so very bad after all, and hints
might possibly sound worse than the actual
facts.</p>

<p>“Do tell Mr. Romayne, from me, that
I hope he hasn’t done anything very shocking!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">{192}</a></span>
she said, with a laugh. “I wanted
Howard to tell me just what it was, but
he would not. Isn’t it funny how men
seem to lose their heads altogether when
they get on to that silly Stock Exchange?
The last men one would expect, too! Who
would have thought of Mr. Romayne’s
getting into trouble of that kind?”</p>

<p>Somewhat to her disgust, Hilda Compton
found as she proceeded that it was impossible
to give such significance to her words as
she would have wished. She realised that
it would never do to allow herself to be
brought to book, and consequently conventionality
demanded that she should adopt
a jesting tone, and trust to Mrs. Romayne’s
possessing some half knowledge which should
give the words the barb she wished for them.
She had a pleasant conviction, as Mrs.
Romayne answered her, that she had done
something, at least, towards wiping out that
old score. The elder woman’s words were
preceded by a harsh little laugh, and there
was something indistinct about their utterance.</p>

<p>“Just so. Who would have thought&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Mrs. Romayne stopped abruptly, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">{193}</a></span>
sharp, extraordinary spasm passed across her
face, leaving it fixed and old.</p>

<p>The girl by her side could not flatter
herself that the effect was produced by her
words, for Mrs. Romayne was gazing to
the other side of the garden, and it was
evidently something she had seen there
which had affected her so powerfully. Turning
her own curious eyes in the same
direction, Hilda Compton saw nothing
calculated to account for such an effect.
The crowd had drifted away to some extent
to the other lawn, and the tennis-courts,
and there was a considerable space, sparsely
sprinkled with people, between where they
stood and the last group on the lawn; a
group of ladies to whom the host was
introducing a little alert, elderly man with
grey hair; a little man who looked to-day&mdash;though
only one pair of the two pair of
women’s eyes fixed upon him across the
lawn recognised this&mdash;exactly as he had
looked twenty years ago.</p>

<p>Hilda Compton did not know him, and
she was wondering curiously whether Mrs.
Romayne did, when she heard their hostess’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">{194}</a></span>
voice and turned quickly. Mrs. Romayne,
roused apparently by finding herself addressed,
had turned also&mdash;very quickly it seemed to
Hilda Compton, and rather as though she
did not wish her face to be seen by some
one on the other side of the garden&mdash;and was
listening with a dazed, strained expression of
enforced attention.</p>

<p>“I want to introduce a connexion of mine,
my dear Mrs. Romayne. Something of a
traveller, and something of an eccentricity;
but, really, worth talking to. There he is!”
indicating the little alert, elderly man on the
other side of the lawn. “He is a Dr. Aston.
May I fetch him?”</p>

<p>To Hilda Compton’s astonishment Mrs.
Romayne stretched out her hand hurriedly in
unmistakeable dissent, and it was shaking like
a leaf.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I must say ‘no,’” she said,
in a hoarse, hurried tone which sounded as
though she could hardly control it. “I have
a long drive, you know, and I must run
away.”</p>

<p>She took her leave so briefly and
hurriedly that her hostess came to the conclusion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">{195}</a></span>
that illness must be the cause of the
seclusion in which she was living, and that
she must have miscalculated her strength that
afternoon.</p>

<p>She might have thought so with even
more reason if she had seen the strange
collapse of her whole figure with which Mrs.
Romayne sank back into the corner of her
carriage as she was driven home along the
country roads. If her attendance at the
garden-party had been indeed a desperate
attempt at finding some sort of temporary
oblivion or distraction, that attempt had
obviously failed. Her face was drawn and set,
and in her eyes, as they stared unseeingly
before her, there was a look as of a woman
who is quivering still under the influence of
some horrible shock.</p>

<p>She had, as she had said, a long drive
home, and as she neared her own house that
look in her eyes faded, displaced by a sick
hunger of anxiety. She got out of the
carriage quickly, helping herself a good deal
as she rose, however, as if that shock had
affected her physical strength.</p>

<p>“Has Mr. Julian come?” she said to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">{196}</a></span>
servant who opened the door; then as the
woman answered in the negative, she moved
swiftly on to where her letters lay waiting
for her, and looked them rapidly over. There
was none from Julian, and she carried them
listlessly upstairs as she went to dress for her
solitary dinner.</p>

<p>The rain, which was falling fast by this
time in London, was just beginning to patter
slowly on the window when she came into
the dining-room; and the wind was rising
and moving gustily round the house. They
were dreary sounds, both of them, and Mrs.
Romayne shivered a little as she sat down.
Apparently the monotonous pattering, growing
quicker and quicker as dinner went on, or
the low howling of the wind, made her
nervous. She ate nothing, and when at last,
the form of dinner having been gone through
with, and the servant having left the room,
she rose and walked aimlessly to the fireplace,
her lips were strangely compressed, and
she seemed to control the expression of her
eyes with a determined effort. It was as
though she were controlling something within
of which the tendency frightened her. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">{197}</a></span>
stood there forgetting, apparently, to go into
the drawing-room, her face fixed and intent
as though she were reasoning or arguing with
herself. At last she shivered sharply and
her lips twitched. Then rousing herself
forcibly, as it seemed, she rang the bell
fiercely, and gave orders that a fire should
be lighted in the drawing-room. It was a
wretched evening, she said to the servant,
as though the audible expression of a tangible
reason for the nervous discomfort which
seemed to be upon her was some sort of
relief to her. The fire lighted, she drew a
chair in front of it, and taking up a novel,
set herself to read with a desperate determination
in every line of her face.</p>

<p>Down one page, line by line, on through
the next, still line by line, her eyes travelled
steadily, mechanically; and then, as mechanically,
her hand moved, turned the leaf, and
her eyes moved on again. But unless her
face greatly belied her, the sense of the words
she read so intently never penetrated to her
brain. By-and-by that movement of her
eyes ceased; she sat staring fixedly at the
page before her; then she let the hand that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">{198}</a></span>
held the book sink gradually on her knee,
and sat staring into space as she had sat
staring at the printed words. Her face was
drawn, and there was an intense, indefinite
dread about it which was none the less
ghastly in that it would have been impossible
to say in which of her set features its shadow
lurked.</p>

<p>The room was absolutely still. Outside
the rain fell and the wind moaned. Inside
the intense quiet seemed to be taking a
weirdly tangible form, and to be creeping
closer and closer round her motionless figure
with every breath she drew.</p>

<p>With a sudden, sharp movement, as
though, in taking a too sharply piercing
point, her thoughts had roused her to a
desperate resistance of them, she rose, and
began to walk restlessly up and down the
room.</p>

<p>Her brows were drawn to a concentration
which made her whole face look thin and
very old. There was an expression of deliberate,
self-conscious self-contempt about
her mouth, but in her eyes there lurked the
battling horror against which all her force<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">{199}</a></span>
seemed to be fiercely arrayed. Up and down
she walked, no muscle of her set face relaxing;
until, quite suddenly, there swept across it,
breaking up all its rigid lines, a very agony
of yearning. It was as though some sudden
and most inopportune realisation, in no wise
to be resisted, had shaken her through and
through.</p>

<p>“If only I had dared to ask him! If
only, if only I dared to speak!”</p>

<p>The words had broken from her half aloud,
a sharp, low cry, and as she uttered them
she stopped in her walk, gripping and clinging
to a chair as if for physical support in a
moment of terrible mental conflict. She was
evidently fighting desperately inch by inch
for the self-control which was slipping
from her; the self-control which she dreaded
to lose as she dreaded nothing else in life;
the self-control to which she clung with the
tenacity of instinctive self-preservation.</p>

<p>She lifted her face at last, still and hard
as resolution could make it. She crossed the
room with quick, resolute steps, looking
neither to the right nor the left, and went
rapidly upstairs to her own room. A desk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">{200}</a></span>
containing a quantity of papers stood on the
chest of drawers. They were old bills and
receipts that needed sorting and destroying,
and she had brought them into the country
saying that she never had time for such work
in town. She went up to this desk now,
lifted it in her two hands, and placing it on
the table, sat down before it and unlocked it.
All her movements were the quick, concentrated
movements of a woman to whom
employment, close, tedious employment, has
become an absolute necessity.</p>

<p>A telegram ten days old was not among
the papers to be sorted, but Mrs. Romayne
held one in her hand as she sat there at her
writing-table. She had drawn it from the
front of her dress and she read and re-read
it, oblivious of the task she had set herself,
with an intensity in her eyes which seemed
as though it would wring a hidden meaning
from the words. It was the telegram Julian
had sent her ten days before. She folded it
at last with a quick defiant gesture and drew
towards her a packet of receipts.</p>

<p>She untied the string that fastened the
papers, and out from among them there fell a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">{201}</a></span>
folded letter, yellow with age, and crumpled. It
had evidently worked its way into that packet
by accident, as papers will when many are
kept together, for it was obviously a letter
and not a bill. Mrs. Romayne stretched out
her hand mechanically and picked it up and
opened it. Her eyes were met by the words,
written in a childish, scrawling, much blotted
handwriting: “My dear mamma.”</p>

<p>It was the letter which she had received
from Julian twenty years ago at Nice.</p>

<p>In an instant, even as her eyes fell on
those faded baby characters, so suddenly and
so utterly that she never realised her loss,
the self-control to which she had clung so
fiercely melted away from Mrs. Romayne.
Before the flash and quiver of recognition
had subsided on her face she had seized
the bell-rope and was ringing furiously
for her maid. The woman, appearing breathless
and alarmed a moment later, found her
mistress searching feverishly for bonnet and
cloak.</p>

<p>“I am going to London, Dawson. Order
the carriage at once.”</p>

<p>The voice was harsh, rapid, and peremptory;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">{202}</a></span>
but the bewildered woman hesitated.</p>

<p>“Now, ma’am?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Romayne turned on her with
such a face as her maid had never seen
before.</p>

<p>“At once, I said. At once!”</p>

<p>The last train was just steaming into
the station when Mrs. Romayne’s carriage
dashed up, the horse smoking and covered
with foam.</p>

<p>She had thrust that yellow little letter
half-unconsciously into her pocket, and all
through the journey she sat motionless,
clasping it tightly in her hand, her eyes wild,
her features forced into a quiescence which sat
upon them like a mask.</p>

<p>That mask seemed to get thin, to break
away now and again, as she drove through
the London streets at last, as though the
wild emotion which it hid was growing too
strong for it. Her breath was coming faster
and faster, until her white, parted lips took
an involuntary line of physical pain.</p>

<p>There were no lights in the house in
Chelsea as her cab drew up. It was twelve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">{203}</a></span>
o’clock. She rang violently, and waited, her
rapid breathing almost suffocating her. No
one came. She rang again, pausing this time
with her hand on the bell; again and again,
furiously, as a wild, unreasoning horror seemed
to seize upon her and tear at her heart.
At last there was a sound as of the tentative
undoing of bolts and turning of keys. The
door was opened an inch or two, and a
frightened woman’s voice said:</p>

<p>“Who is it?”</p>

<p>A moment later there was no possibility
of doubt on that score. The door was
hurriedly thrown open, and Mrs. Romayne
moved swiftly into the hall, turning fiercely
to confront the astonished, partially-dressed
servant, whose bedroom candle seemed to be
the only light in the house.</p>

<p>“Has Mr. Julian gone to bed?” she
demanded, and the woman hardly recognised
her mistress’s voice.</p>

<p>“Mr. Julian is not here, ma’am!” she
answered. “He has not been here since
the day before yesterday.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">{204}</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">“Mr. Falconer,</span> sir! Mr. Falconer!”</p>

<p>Dennis Falconer was a light sleeper,
and he was awake on the first call, low and
hurried as it was. It must be a very bad
morning, he said to himself, for the light
was not nearly so strong as it usually was
when he was called at eight o’clock.</p>

<p>“All right!” he called back.</p>

<p>But the retreating footsteps that usually
ensued upon his answer did not follow.</p>

<p>“There’s a lady, sir, to see you, please.
She’s waiting in the sitting-room. ‘Mrs.
Romayne,’ she told me to say.”</p>

<p>“What!” It was a sharp exclamation
of inexpressible astonishment, and as he
uttered it Falconer sprang out of bed. As
he did so he realised that the unusualness
of the light was due to the unusualness of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">{205}</a></span>
hour&mdash;seven o’clock only. “Some one from
Mrs. Romayne, you mean?” he called, his
strong, deep voice full of incredulity and
apprehension. Then, as the answer came
through the door, “‘Mrs. Romayne,’ sir,
the lady said,” he called back hurriedly:
“Say I will be with her in a moment.”</p>

<p>Very few moments indeed had passed
before Falconer’s bedroom door opened and
he came out with a rapid step. He opened
his sitting-room door and passed in, shutting
the door hastily behind him, and as he did
so the words of grave concern with which
he had entered died upon his lips.</p>

<p>In the disorder and dreariness of a room
from which the traces of yesterday’s usage
had not yet been obliterated; in the cold
grey light of the early September morning;
a woman was pacing up and down with almost
frenzied steps. For a moment, as he caught
his first glimpse of the face, he thought
vaguely that it was not Mrs. Romayne;
then it turned and confronted him, and,
meeting the eyes, he recognised, not the
woman whom he had known during the past
two years, but the woman into whose face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">{206}</a></span>
he had looked with so strange a shock of
unfamiliarity, and for one moment only, as
he and Dr. Aston had confronted it together
twenty years ago in Nice. Every trace of
the Mrs. Romayne of to-day seemed to have
vanished, scorched away by the consuming
fire which burnt in her blue eyes and seemed
to be the only thing that lived behind that
ghastly face; even her features were drawn and
sunken almost beyond recognition.</p>

<p>An almost paralysing sense of unreality
fell upon Dennis Falconer, for all his practical
common sense; and before he could recover
himself sufficiently for speech, Mrs. Romayne
had crossed the room to him, attempting
no greeting, swept away on a tide before
which all the barriers of her life&mdash;all the safeguards,
as they had seemed to her&mdash;had gone
down in one common ruin.</p>

<p>“Dennis Falconer,” she cried hoarsely,
“my boy is gone&mdash;gone! Help me to think
what I must do&mdash;help me to think how I
can find him! Help me! Help me!”</p>

<p>The words themselves were an appeal,
but they rang out in that harsh, untuned
voice with all the fierce peremptoriness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">{207}</a></span>
a command, and as she spoke them Mrs.
Romayne beat her hands one against the
other, as though her agony were indeed too
great to be endured. Falconer, utterly confounded&mdash;more
by her manner than by her
tidings, which, indeed, in his slow and bewildered
sense of the extraordinarily direct
communication which her words had established
between herself and him, he hardly
grasped&mdash;echoed the one word which seemed
to contain a definite statement.</p>

<p>“Gone?” he said. “Gone?”</p>

<p>“Gone!” she returned, repeating the
word as she had done before in a kind of
hoarse cry. “Oh, let me try and make you
understand clearly, that we may lose no time.
Time! Ah! who knows how much may have
been lost already? My boy! my boy!”</p>

<p>She strangled the cry in her very throat,
and laying one hand on Falconer’s arm with
a convulsive grip, as if to steady herself, she
lifted the other to her head, pushing the hair
back from her forehead and pressing her
fingers down as though to force herself to
think and speak coherently.</p>

<p>“I had a telegram from him,” she said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">{208}</a></span>
speaking in short, quick sentences with heavy,
panting breaths between, “ten days ago. It
said that he was going to stop in town for
a few days. Yesterday I heard something
that made me uneasy. I came up to speak
to him late last night. I expected to find
him in Queen Anne Street. He was not
there. He has not been there for the last
two nights. He is gone!” She stopped as
though in those three words she had summed
up all the horror of the situation; and with
that strange sense of unreality making his
voice stiff and constrained, Falconer said:</p>

<p>“But must you necessarily apprehend anything
alarming? Some private visit, perhaps;
a painful discovery, of course&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>She tore her hand away from his arm,
wringing it fiercely with its fellow as she
faced him, breaking in upon his words with
a passionate cry.</p>

<p>“Apprehend! Apprehend! I know, I tell
you, I know! Ah! have I been watching and
fighting for so many years; have I planned
and struggled and sickened with fear; not
to know, now that it has overtaken me at
last? Dennis Falconer, don’t palter with me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">{209}</a></span>
You know what lies about my boy. You
know what horrible inheritance I have had
to battle with for him. Good Heaven! when
have you spared me your knowledge of it?
When have you failed to thrust it on me, to
force me to shudder and sicken even when
I felt most secure?”</p>

<p>She paused, battling for breath; and then,
as Falconer tried to speak, she put out her
hand to stop him, and went on hurriedly:</p>

<p>“That’s all over! It’s done with! Now
you must help me. Your knowledge must
help me. You are a man. You will know
what to do; how he can be saved! He must
be saved! He must!”</p>

<p>She turned away from him with a wild,
unconscious gesture, as though his personality
had no existence for her save and except as
he could serve her purpose, and began once
more to pace up and down the room.</p>

<p>Falconer followed her with his eyes, standing
motionless and confounded. The very
foundation on which stood his every conception
with regard to the woman before
him, and the life she lived, had suddenly
melted into nothingness before her passionate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">{210}</a></span>
words, and there seemed for the time being
to be no stability anywhere about him. It
was no light that her words let in upon
him. Rather, they rolled over that mental
tract of country which had been to him perfectly
familiar and commonplace, a darkness
in which every landmark was obliterated. In
those first bewildered seconds his most prominent
sensation was one of utter blackness&mdash;the
mental counterpart of the effect produced
upon the physical vision by the
sudden substitution of illimitable darkness
for a narrow and well-known scene.</p>

<p>“What do you fear?” he said. He
spoke almost like an automaton, in a low,
tentative tone.</p>

<p>“He has been speculating.” She never
stopped in her rushing walk. “I have
known it for months, and I have been in
torment.” There was a strange, scathed
look on her face which gave the words a
terrible reality. “He has had some heavy
anxiety on his mind all the summer&mdash;what,
I don’t know. But this is the end of it.
Oh, my boy, my darling, what have I done
that you should shut your mother out? I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">{211}</a></span>
have slaved for you! I have slaved for
you, and I will slave for you as long as
I live! Why have you gone away from
me?”</p>

<p>She was not crying. To Falconer, watching
her and listening to her, no tears could
have been so terrible as that bitter, dry-eyed
wail which seemed to him to echo
in a void, where nothing answering to it
could have been nurtured into life. The
contrast between the artificial woman he
had known hitherto, and the woman in the
consuming anguish of her motherhood with
whom he now found himself face to face,
was so amazing that he could make no
attempt to grapple with it. He took desperate
and instinctive refuge in the practical.</p>

<p>“Do you know anything of his City
associations?” he said.</p>

<p>She made a despairing gesture of negation.</p>

<p>“I did!” she said hoarsely. “I did all
I knew to keep in touch with him. Two
months ago Marston Loring could have told
me anything. But everything failed me!
Everything crumbled away! They quarrelled.”</p>

<p>Already, with that matter-of-fact tendency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">{212}</a></span>
inherent in all men&mdash;and particularly in
unimaginative men&mdash;which assimilates a
revelation, and reduces it involuntarily to a
commonplace, Falconer had become almost
accustomed to the new point of view which
had been forced upon him. The darkness
was lifting, and he was aware of vast tracts
of mental country, destitute of those landmarks
which his soul loved, but no longer
enveloped in a dense atmosphere of confusion.</p>

<p>A man of Falconer’s narrow temperament,
confirmed in his rigidity by many years of
life, having his set conceptions suddenly
overthrown and forcibly enlarged, will be
totally incapable of any just appreciation of
the new horizon then created; he will be
conscious of the spaces about him only as
confusing unrealities; the limitations solidified
by the mental habits of years will retain
some sort of ghostly influence over him long
after they have ceased to have any actual
existence. His first conscious and deliberate
movement will be an instinctive attempt to
reconcile the new condition of things with
these old limitations, rather than to reconcile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">{213}</a></span>
himself with the new conditions. The facts
which Mrs. Romayne’s words recalled to him;
the character of the man whom she had
encouraged as her son’s chief intimate; the
character of the life to which she had bred
him; gave definite force to the vague movement
towards such reconciliation already stirring
in Falconer’s mind. He accepted the
revelation of unsuspected mother’s love and
mother’s dread, and ceased to contemplate
it as he concentrated his mental vision on
the selfish vanity and worldliness with which
Mrs. Romayne had stood endued in his
thoughts for twenty years; and as his point
of view readjusted itself on these lines, her
present position, with all the suffering which
it involved, presented itself to him solely as
the inevitable climax of a simple and eminently
comprehensible sequence of cause and
effect.</p>

<p>His voice was low and stern as he said:</p>

<p>“Can you not think of any other friend
who could give us some clue to his recent
movements?”</p>

<p>“I can’t!” she cried, stopping in her
rapid walk, and confronting him fiercely.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">{214}</a></span>
“It is because there is no one left; because
I don’t know what to do, or where to turn,
that I have come to you! Should I be
wasting time like this if I could think of
any other means of acting? I’m tied hand
and foot in the dark&mdash;tied to the rack,
man! We can do nothing till we find him&mdash;till
we know what has happened. Think,
think, think! How are we to find him?
How are we to&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Her voice, which had risen into an
agonised cry, broke suddenly; a greyish tint
spread itself over her face, and all her features
were contorted as if with horrible physical
pain. She stretched out her hand feebly
and gropingly, caught at an arm-chair, and
fell into it, letting her face fall forward on
its back as her nails pressed themselves
pitilessly into her thin hands.</p>

<p>“It&mdash;it’s nothing!” she gasped, in a tight,
suppressed voice, fighting desperately, as it
seemed, to utter words rather than groans.
“I have been ill! The night&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The words died away, caught and strangled
by the relentless, stabbing pain, and Falconer,
utterly at a loss, stood for a moment helplessly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">{215}</a></span>
watching her, and then strode across
the room meaning to call a woman to his
aid. He opened the door hurriedly and then
stopped short. On the shelf fixed against the
wall facing him there lay his morning letters,
and on the top of the pile lay one directed
in Julian’s handwriting. Mrs. Romayne’s
physical distress sank into insignificance for
him. The physical suffering which had fallen
to his lot during the past year had by no
means obliterated the lifelong instinct which
led him to look upon such weakness as a
detail to be disregarded, and of women he
knew nothing. He turned back into the
room with the letter in his hand, and shutting
the door again opened it hastily. It was the
letter Julian had written on the previous
day in his room in the Temple.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">“<span class="smcap">Dear Falconer</span>,” he read,&mdash;“I’ve done
for myself all round, and by the time you
get this I shall be out of England. It’s penal
servitude if I stay. The smash will come
in a day or two and you will understand.
It’s all up with me; but there’s my wife
and child&mdash;for Heaven’s sake be kind to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">{216}</a></span>
them. This is the address.” The address
followed, and then the signature.</p>

</div>

<p>For another moment Dennis Falconer
stood motionless with his eyes fixed on the
letter, so despairing in its hopeless brevity,
so terribly eloquent of immeasurable disgrace
and wrong. Then he lifted his head and
turned towards Mrs. Romayne. She had not
moved, she was apparently unconscious of
his presence; the tense rigidity of her position
had passed into a total collapse, in which
all her figure seemed to have fallen together
as if in absolute exhaustion. To Falconer
she presented an appearance only of most
desirable quiet, and he hesitated simply as
to how he should so break to her what
must be broken, as to excite her least. She
would have to see the letter! He glanced
at it again on the thought, and a cold shock
seemed to strike him as he realised the total
oblivion of his mother to which the young
man’s last appeal bore witness.</p>

<p>“I have received some news,” he said.</p>

<p>His tone, as he spoke, was curiously
different from any in which he had ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">{217}</a></span>
before addressed her. It was grave, straightforward,
and not unkindly, and it very subtly&mdash;and
quite unconsciously&mdash;conveyed the
altered attitude of a stern and narrow moralist
towards wrong-doing, no longer triumphant
and serene, but writhing under its merited
suffering. A certain stern compassion the
new position of affairs demanded of him,
and he gave it; but it was that lofty
compassion which is more than half composed
of a sense of the righteousness of
the retribution meted out; with sympathy
or respect it was utterly untouched. He
was prepared to help her to the utmost;
he was steady reliability itself; but his help
was permeated, as was his compassion,
with a superior recognition of the justice
of the trouble which rendered that help
necessary.</p>

<p>As though there was something between
her and her surroundings through which his
voice must penetrate before it reached her
brain, a second or two elapsed before Mrs.
Romayne gave any sign of having heard
him. Then she moved and turned her face
towards him, looking at him as though from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">{218}</a></span>
long way off. Her forehead and the hair about
it, strangely colourless and dead-looking, were
damp. Grey shadows had fallen about her
mouth. There was a faint struggle in her
dull eyes, as though she had heard his words
and was trying to force her way to an
understanding of them through overwhelming
physical disabilities.</p>

<p>“I am sorry to say it is far from reassuring,”
continued Falconer.</p>

<p>A sudden flash of understanding and
conviction flashed across her features, and
its spirit dominated her weakness as its
light transfigured her face. She rose, clinging
to the chair, but evidently absolutely unconscious
of any physical sensation, and held
out her hand, still clammy and tremulous
with pain.</p>

<p>“Give it me,” she said, indicating the
letter he held. Her voice was a thin whisper.
Then, as he hesitated: “You’re wasting time.
Give it me.”</p>

<p>He gave it her without a word and
turned away. It would break her down, of
course, he thought; perhaps into some wild
form of hysteria at the position in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">{219}</a></span>
the young man confessed himself; perhaps
into passionate repudiation of the son who
had so deceived her, and who was leaving
her without word or sign. Moments passed,
three or four perhaps, and then a tense,
insistent touch fell on his arm and he turned.
Mrs. Romayne was standing by his side,
Julian’s letter held tightly in her hand, which
trembled no longer. Her eyes were bright,
almost hard in their determination, and every
line and muscle of her face and figure was
braced and set into a vivid strength and
resolution.</p>

<p>“We must see this woman at once,” she
said, and her voice was as strange in its
desperate energy as was her face. Then,
as Falconer only looked at her blankly, she
added, in the same absorbed, concentrated
way: “You will come with me?”</p>

<p>“You mean you will see&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I must see this woman,” she repeated,
tapping the paper impatiently with her hand.
“Don’t you see she will probably know where
he is? She must know! Let us go at
once!”</p>

<p>“But if she does know?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">{220}</a></span></p>

<p>“If she does know! Why, that is everything!
I can follow him. He is frightened&mdash;he
has lost his head. If he goes away like
this he is lost. I am going to stop him.”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>She silenced him with a movement of her
hand, before which his words died on his
lips.</p>

<p>“Dennis Falconer,” she said, “help me or
refuse to help me as you like, but don’t try to
stop me. The shadow of a horror such as this
has haunted me for twenty years. I bring
the nerve and desperation of twenty years to
meet it now, and I am going to save him.
Will you come?”</p>

<p>Dominated against his will, sternly disapproving,
but powerless to assert his disapprobation
in the face of the intensity of her
determination, Falconer made a slight gesture
of enforced assent. Mrs. Romayne hardly
waited for it before she turned and went
swiftly out of the room and down the
stairs.</p>

<p>It was early still&mdash;not yet eight o’clock&mdash;and
cabs were hardly to be found. They met
one at last, and Falconer put her into it and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">{221}</a></span>
looked at her, obviously with an intention of
uttering the protest with which his face was
full. She made a peremptory sign that he
should give the address, holding out the letter
containing it, and instantly reclaiming it.
Her nerves were evidently strung beyond the
possibility of irrelevant or unnecessary speech.
A long drive followed to a dingy, poverty-stricken
neighbourhood, and then, in a dreary-looking
little street, the cab stopped. Mrs.
Romayne got out with the same rapid, concentrated
movements, signing again, with a
movement of her set lips, to Falconer that he
should ring and make the necessary enquiries.
The bell was answered, after an appreciable
interval, by a slatternly-looking girl.</p>

<p>“A young woman lodges here, I believe,”
said Falconer sternly&mdash;“a young married
woman. Mrs.&mdash;Mrs. Roden, or Romayne?”</p>

<p>The girl stared at him for a moment
with bold, curious eyes, and then transferred
the stare to Mrs. Romayne, with a coarse
giggle.</p>

<p>“Young married woman?” she repeated,
with a toss of the head. “Oh, yes; of course!
Top floor back!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">{222}</a></span></p>

<p>Before the last words, which conveyed a
general intimation that visitors for the top
floor back were expected to show themselves
up, were well uttered, Mrs. Romayne had
crossed the dirty little passage with swift
steps and was mounting the stairs. She went
straight on until she reached the top landing,
and then she turned sharply to Falconer, who
had followed her closely. His judgement
condemned her proceedings utterly, but his
stern sense of her claim upon him remained
untouched, and he believed himself to be
merely waiting until her impulse should fail
her, as it seemed to him it must before long,
to take matters into his own hands.</p>

<p>“Knock!” she said.</p>

<p>Falconer obeyed her; the door was opened
with a quiet, sad-toned “Yes?” and Clemence
stood on the threshold.</p>

<p>She was looking very fragile and very
white; the haggard look of suffering had left
her, but it had taken with it in the passing
all the physical strength from her face. Her
eyes were heavy as with sleeplessness and tears,
and from their depths there seemed to emanate
the quiet grief which spoke in every line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">{223}</a></span>
of her face. She held her baby in her
arms, and her whole personality seemed to
be touched by the mysterious influence of
motherhood into a new dignity and beauty.
To Falconer the change in her since he had
seen her in Camden Town was so great as to
give him a moment’s absolute shock; it was
the same woman, and yet not the same. The
difference lay, for him, rather in the evidences
of long suffering which spoke so eloquently
about that woman’s face and form, than
in the work effected by that suffering; and
the feeling that the sight of her stirred in
him was one of pity; a man’s half indignant,
half patronising pity for weakness and
trust abused.</p>

<p>But Falconer she did not seem to see.
Instantly, as she opened the door, her eyes
had passed to where Mrs. Romayne stood
confronting her, her face absorbed, concentrated,
hard as steel. A faint flush of
colour flooded Clemence’s face; then she
lowered her eyes, and stood with her head a
little bent over her child, motionless.</p>

<p>“You are my son’s wife?”</p>

<p>The words came from Mrs. Romayne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">{224}</a></span>
quick, terse, utterly untouched and unemotional,
as though the situation in itself were
absolutely devoid of meaning for her.</p>

<p>“My husband’s name is Julian Romayne,”
was the low answer.</p>

<p>Mrs. Romayne made a quick, imperious
gesture indicative of her desire to pass into
the little room, on the threshold of which
Clemence was standing. Clemence made way
for her with quiet dignity, and then followed
her in. Falconer hesitated an instant and
took up his position in the doorway, holding
himself in grave, attentive readiness until
the moment when his presence should be required.
The little room was scrupulously neat
and clean. Facing him, a strangely incongruous
figure amid such poor surroundings, but
apparently as absolutely unconscious of them
as of the child&mdash;at which she never glanced&mdash;stood
Mrs. Romayne. Facing Mrs. Romayne
stood Clemence, paler now than before, and
with her head bent a little lower. Falconer
could see that she trembled slightly. Mrs.
Romayne began to speak instantly, in the
same hard, rapid tone.</p>

<p>“Where is my son?” she said. “You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">{225}</a></span>
have been told, perhaps, to say you do not
know&mdash;to keep his plans secret. You must
give them up instantly to me. He has made
a mistake, and only prompt action can
redeem it. When did you see him last?
What did he tell you?”</p>

<p>As though some subtle influence from the
one woman had penetrated to the heart of the
other, Clemence’s face had turned quite white.
For her, too, the personal aspect of the
situation seemed suddenly to sink into
abeyance. Her head was lifted, and her eyes,
filled with a creeping apprehension, were
fixed full upon Mrs. Romayne, oblivious of
anything but the one interest which they held
in common.</p>

<p>The man watching them was vaguely
conscious of something about the two women
which put him quite away from them; which
made him the merest spectator of something
to which he had no key.</p>

<p>“I saw him last night,” said Clemence,
hurriedly and fearfully; “he came to say
good-bye!”</p>

<p>A kind of hoarse cry broke from Mrs.
Romayne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">{226}</a></span></p>

<p>“Good-bye!” she cried, as though appealing
to some encircling environment of fate.
“And she let him go! She let him go!”
She stopped herself, forcing down her passion
with an iron hand, and went on in a tone
only colder and more decisive in its greater
rapidity than before. “He has made a
mistake; you cannot understand, of course.
No doubt it seems to you that everything to
be desired is comprised in the miserable
subterfuge of flight. No doubt&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>She was interrupted. With a low cry of
unutterable horror Clemence had drawn a step
nearer to her, pressing her baby passionately
to her heart.</p>

<p>“Flight!” she cried. “Flight! Ah,
I knew! I knew there was something wrong!
What is it? Oh, what is it? My dear,
my dear, what have you done? What have
you done?”</p>

<p>There was an instant’s dead silence as the
cry died away and Clemence stood with her
beseeching eyes dark and dilated, her uplifted
face white and quivering, appealing, as it
seemed, for an answer, to Julian himself.
Falconer was looking straight before him, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">{227}</a></span>
face set and grim, passive, not only with
the natural passivity of a man in the presence
of inevitable anguish, but with the involuntary
self-forgetfulness of a man in the presence
of a power greater than he can understand.
Mrs. Romayne had paused as though stopped
by some kind of hard, annoyed surprise.</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Romayne went on in a thin,
tense voice:</p>

<p>“There is no time to waste over what has
been done; the point is to retrieve it! He
must come back at once. Where is he?”</p>

<p>With a sudden quick movement Clemence
turned, crossed the room, and laid the child
tenderly in the little cot standing by the fire.
She pressed her face down for one instant to
the tiny sleep-flushed cheek, and then rose
and came back to Mrs. Romayne and Falconer,
her face white and resolute, her eyes shining,
glancing from one to the other as she spoke.</p>

<p>“Will there be time?” she said. “Can I
get to him before he sails? There is a woman
downstairs who will take care of my child.
He is alone! He may be doing&mdash;&mdash;Flight!
What can flight do for him if he has done
wrong? He doesn’t always know! I am his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">{228}</a></span>
wife, and I must go and help him. Will there
be time?”</p>

<p>It was Falconer to whom her eyes
finally turned, vaguely conscious of the
absence of womanly sympathy, and appealing
in the void for a man’s knowledge and
assistance. It was Falconer who answered
her. Instinctively and involuntarily he
answered her directly, the current of his
thoughts seeming to submit itself to hers
without an impulse to resist or control her.</p>

<p>“Where was he going?” he said.</p>

<p>“To America!” was the answer, eager and
low, as though life and death hung on the
response it should elicit. “He was going
then, he told me. That was at nine o’clock last
night! Oh, if I go at once I shall be in time?
I shall be in time?”</p>

<p>A hard, nervous irritation was disturbing
the concentration of Mrs. Romayne’s face.
Futile and utterly to be ignored as seemed
to her any impulse on the part of the woman
to whom, in the face of the terrible issues
with which she stood confronted, she gave
no personal consideration whatever; the introduction
of such futility seemed, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">{229}</a></span>
strained, tense condition of her nerves, to
involve irrelevancy and delay, which she
was utterly unable to meet with any self-command.
She broke in now, her voice
harsh and vibrating with uncontrollable
impatience.</p>

<p>“There is no need,” she said. “I am
on my way to him now. You&mdash;there is no
need for you! You can do nothing!”</p>

<p>“I am his wife!” said Clemence.</p>

<p>She did not raise her voice; no colour
came to her dead, white face; only she
turned to Julian’s mother, with her hands
crushed tightly together against her heart,
and such a light shining in her eyes as seemed
to transfigure her whole face and figure. For
an instant the eyes of the two women met and
held one another. Then Mrs. Romayne, with
a gesture which seemed to repudiate and
deny the influence which nevertheless she
was powerless to resist, turned to Falconer
and moved swiftly towards the door. “What
does it matter?” she said, in a tone of fierce
impatience, which relegated Clemence to the
position of the merest nonentity. “The only
thing of consequence is time!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">{230}</a></span></p>

<p>She swept out of the room as she spoke,
and Clemence turned again to Falconer,
stretching out beseeching hands.</p>

<p>“Help me!” she said.</p>

<p>The movement which he had thought to
guide and control so easily had passed beyond
Falconer’s control, and he knew it. He could
only follow it, waiting until the turn of
events should throw it, as he still believed
they must, upon a man’s strength and experience.
But as Clemence had touched him
once before against his will, she touched him
now against his judgement, and he answered
her in one word:</p>

<p>“Come!”</p>

<p>Throughout the terrible hours that followed;
during the drive to the station, the sickening
suspense, the brief interval of waiting for a
train, the long journey; neither by word nor
sign did Mrs. Romayne evince the slightest
consciousness of Clemence’s presence. Her
face, almost stony now in its set determination,
never altered. After they were seated
in the train she never spoke at all. She sat
gazing straight before her, motionless as a
statue, like a woman living only by her hold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">{231}</a></span>
upon a moment in the future, to which each
present second as it passed was bringing her
nearer.</p>

<p>There had been no time to ascertain the
probabilities as to their forestalling the sailing
of the boat in which Julian had presumably
intended to leave England. Falconer, while
admitting to himself that the young man
might have over-estimated, panic-stricken, the
danger in which he had placed himself, had
but faint hope that any steps other than
the promotion of his speedy departure would
be possible when they should be in possession
of the facts; even should their arrival be in
time to frustrate his original determination.
But Mrs. Romayne weighed no probabilities.
She looked neither to the right nor to the
left. She saw before her only the climax
and consummation of the struggle of twenty
years, and on that consummation was concentrated
her whole existence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">{232}</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> room was very still; even the clock
upon the mantelpiece was not going, so that
not even a low tick disturbed the perfect
quiet. It was a sitting-room in one of the
Liverpool hotels, and quite alone in it was
Clemence. She was sitting near the window,
motionless, her hands clasped tightly together
on her knee. Her face was lifted
slightly towards the sky, and its calm,
broken now and again by a slight quiver
of the lips, was that of intense absorption.
Clemence’s was one of those natures in which
great mental suffering of any kind passes
instinctively into unformed prayer; and she
was praying now with her whole being, with
no faintest consciousness of herself or her
mental attitude.</p>

<p>She had been sitting there alone and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">{233}</a></span>
motionless for more than an hour, when a
touch fell upon the handle of the door.
She started violently, and rose involuntarily
to her feet as it opened to admit Falconer.
She did not speak; all her agony of
questioning seemed to have passed into the
eyes she fixed upon him, and into those
tightly-clasped hands.</p>

<p>Falconer crossed the room quickly to
her, and spoke as though in answer to
audible words.</p>

<p>“I have found him!” he said. “There
has been some delay. The boat will not
leave until to-morrow, and till then he is
here.”</p>

<p>A breath of unutterable relief and thanksgiving
broke from Clemence’s white lips, and
she let her face fall forward for a moment
on her hands. Then she lifted it again,
tremulous and shaken. “Is it&mdash;right&mdash;that
he should go?” she said.</p>

<p>“It is necessary!” returned Falconer
sternly. But the sternness was not for her.</p>

<p>A look of trouble and perplexity passed
into her face; her lips were parted to speak
again when a door at the other end of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">{234}</a></span>
room opened sharply&mdash;not the door by which
Falconer had entered, but a second, leading,
presumably, into a bedroom&mdash;and Mrs.
Romayne appeared. The rigidity of her
self-control had given place, apparently, to
a consuming fever. Her eyes were glittering,
the dry skin seemed to be too tightly drawn
across her sharpened features. There was no
paint upon her now&mdash;no mask, less tangible
but no less effective, of artificiality of expression.
It was the very woman, stripped
of all the trappings of her life, bearing the
ravages of past struggles thick upon her,
driven to bay, and braced to hold the struggle
on which she was entering with the last
breath in her body. She was still dressed
for walking, and the contrast between the
smart, somewhat youthful, apparel which
she had always affected, and her face, was
terrible to see.</p>

<p>She came straight up to Falconer, utterly
unconscious, apparently, as far as feeling
and realisation constitute consciousness, of
Clemence’s presence. “You have found
him?” she said, and the words were less
a question than an assertion. “Let us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">{235}</a></span>
go at once. Stop, though!” she added
abruptly, laying a burning hand on Falconer’s
arm, as though in the haste and pressure
of her own impulses she ascribed a similar
impatience to him. “I had better know the
facts first. What has he told you?”</p>

<p>Falconer hesitated. His words, when
he spoke, ignored her final question, and
answered the idea which vibrated behind
every word of her speech. He glanced at
Clemence as he began to speak as though
he wished his words to apply to her also.</p>

<p>“I do not think,” he said, “that anything
will be gained by your seeing him&mdash;except
extreme distress for all concerned. I fear
there is nothing to be done!”</p>

<p>He had spoken very firmly, as though
the moment had arrived, in his estimation,
for that stand on manly judgement which he
had involuntarily postponed for so long; and
he paused as though to accentuate the weight
of his words.</p>

<p>Mrs. Romayne, with a gesture of irrepressible,
tortured impatience, but otherwise
with no recognition whatever of his having
spoken, repeated her question:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">{236}</a></span></p>

<p>“What has he told you?”</p>

<p>Clemence’s eyes, fixed upon Falconer’s
face, dilated slightly, and then the shadow
of a smile touched her parted lips.</p>

<p>“I fear there is no doubt that it is a
bad affair,” continued Falconer. “There are
forged documents connected with it, and
misappropriation of money fraudulently come
by; and detection seems to be inevitable.
His only hope of safety lies in flight.”</p>

<p>As though with the very tangibility and
imminence of the danger she had come forth
to meet Mrs. Romayne’s spirit rose higher,
the only sort of change brought to her face
by the words was an intensifying of all its
previous characteristics of growing courage
and determination. From Clemence’s lips
the little tremulous light had died, quenched
in such a horror of vicarious shame, of pity,
love, and anguish unspeakable, as seemed to
freeze her where she stood.</p>

<p>“The facts! The facts!” The words
came from Mrs. Romayne sharp and tense,
seeming to put aside and ignore any extraneous
comment or opinion.</p>

<p>Falconer hesitated again for a moment and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">{237}</a></span>
scanned her face closely, absolutely unconscious
of his own incapacity for reading
what was written there. So far was he from
an adequate conception of the realities of the
situation, that he thought that a plain statement
of details would crush out for ever the
hope of which he was conscious in her. And
he decided that such instantaneous crushing
was the only mercy he could show her.</p>

<p>Gravely and concisely, with no unnecessary
comment, he told her the whole
story as he had gathered it half an hour
earlier from Julian’s incoherent, despairing
words. He finished and paused, holding
himself braced for the outbreak of despair
which he expected.</p>

<p>His words were followed by a dead
silence. His eyes were fixed on Mrs.
Romayne with a vague fear for her reason,
and he felt rather than saw that Clemence
had turned away and was standing with
her face hidden in her hands. Mrs.
Romayne’s brows had contracted as if in
intense thought, and her eyes were extraordinarily
bright and keen. At last, with
no slightest relaxation of the intent calculation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">{238}</a></span>
of her face, she asked one or two
questions as to details of business procedure,
the words coming from her sharp
and distinct; questions of which Falconer,
as he answered them, tried in vain to see
the drift. Then she moved with a gesture
of determination, so self-absorbed that it
seemed to isolate her utterly.</p>

<p>“Take me to him at once!” she said.</p>

<p>A sharp exclamation broke from Falconer,
and, as she moved towards the door, he
followed her hastily, indescribably disturbed
and confused by so entirely unexpected a
course of action.</p>

<p>“To what purpose?” he said quickly. “I
beg of you to be advised by me. The boy
must go! Nothing can be gained but a
parting&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Mrs. Romayne turned upon him and faced
him suddenly.</p>

<p>“I am here to see my son,” she said, and
there was something in her voice&mdash;rather in
what its intense restraint suggested than in
its tones themselves&mdash;absolutely dominating
and conclusive. “You came to help me. Take
me to him, or tell me where to find him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">{239}</a></span></p>

<p>Intensely annoyed and disapproving;
keenly alive to the fear that Julian, so
taken by surprise, might impute to him some
definitely treacherous intention in withholding,
as he had done, the fact that he
was not alone; Falconer yet felt himself
powerless. He had no shadow of a right
to stand between mother and son. He had
made his stand, and he might as effectually
have opposed himself to the wind. His
words, his judgement, were as nothing to her.
That he should so far fail to carry into effect
his conception of his duty as her escort, as to
let her go alone was, of course, impossible in
his eyes. He made a sternly unwilling sign
to the effect that he would perforce accompany
her, and then, as she passed quickly out of
the room, he looked at Clemence. There was
a stunned look upon her face now; she did
not even glance at him in answer, but she
moved mechanically, as it seemed, and like a
woman walking in her sleep, and followed
Mrs. Romayne.</p>

<p>Not one word was spoken by either of the
trio until they stood, a quarter of an hour
later, before a rather dingy door in a dreary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">{240}</a></span>
passage of an unpretentious and obscure
private hotel. Then Falconer spoke in a low,
stern tone.</p>

<p>“Here!” he said, indicating the door
before them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Romayne moved swiftly forward and
turned the handle. For one instant, as the
door opened, there was a vision of a dull,
bare little sitting-room, touched with a strange
glory by a red ray from the setting sun,
which slanted right across it; and in the
middle of the room, in the full light of that
red ray, which fell with an almost weird
effect of irradiation upon his attitude of
despair, Julian sitting by the table, his head
buried on his outstretched arms. For an
instant only the picture was visible; then
Julian turned his head sharply and sprang to
his feet with a cry. His mother was advancing
rapidly towards him, but it was not
his mother that he saw. It was the figure
behind her with the dazed white face all
breaking up now into quivering lines. It was
to that figure that he stretched out his hands
with the hoarse, heart-broken sob:</p>

<p>“Clemmie! Clemmie! They’ve told you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">{241}</a></span></p>

<p>Before the words were uttered, Clemence
had rushed past Mrs. Romayne, and was
clinging to him in such a sudden agony of
sobs and tears as seemed to rend her very
heart.</p>

<p>Mrs. Romayne stopped abruptly. Falconer,
who was close to her with his back
to the door which he had shut swiftly on
Julian’s cry, saw a spasm of pain cut across
the concentration of her face for an instant;
and in the flash of anger and impatience
which succeeded it, she seemed to recognise
Clemence’s presence practically for the first
time. She fell back a step or two, waiting
with contemptuous self-control, her eyes fixed
upon the pair before her as they clung
together, and Julian tried brokenly and
despairingly to soothe the pitiful abandonment
of grief with which Clemence was shaken.
His own distress increased with every incoherent
word of self-reproach he uttered; and
it was a sense of his anguish that seemed, at
last, to reach Clemence, and produce in her
a woman’s instinct towards the suppression
of her own pain. She disengaged herself
gently, forcing back the heavy sob that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">{242}</a></span>
trembled on her lips, and looked from Julian
towards Mrs. Romayne with a tacit recognition
of his mother’s claims which was as beautiful
as it was instinctive.</p>

<p>“You will listen!” she said in a choked,
beseeching voice, “you will listen and come
back!”</p>

<p>She turned away as she spoke, making
him a sign that he should not speak to her;
and as she drew away from him Mrs. Romayne
advanced rapidly, every movement, every line
of her face, every tone of her voice, claiming
as an inalienable right her son’s attention.
Her face was very hard, far harder than it had
been before that spasm of pain had shaken it,
and there was no touch of emotion in her
hard, quick voice. She seemed to have put
all sentiment deliberately aside.</p>

<p>“Julian,” she said, “you have made a
terrible mistake! You are taking just the one
false step that would be absolutely irretrievable.
You must come back to town at
once!”</p>

<p>Her manner; her voice; some influence
from the long past days when her word, for
all her affectation of weak indulgence, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">{243}</a></span>
been his law; had arrested his attention
almost without his own consent. He stood
now looking at her; looking at her across such
a gulf of ignorance, mistake, and wrong as had
swallowed even that bitterness with which he
had once regarded her, leaving him absolutely
cold and dead to her.</p>

<p>“Town and I have parted company,
mother!” he said. He spoke hoarsely, but
the emotion in his tone was the reflex of
that through which he had just passed in
meeting Clemence; his manner was even
callous.</p>

<p>“That would be true indeed,” was the
quick answer, “if you had succeeded in
leaving England! Not only town and you,
but life and you&mdash;everything that makes life
worth living&mdash;would have parted company!
To go away now is to cut your own
throat!”</p>

<p>Julian turned to Falconer.</p>

<p>“Haven’t you told them?” he said
thickly. “Don’t they know that&mdash;that is
done?”</p>

<p>Falconer drew a step nearer.</p>

<p>“Your mother knows&mdash;&mdash;” he began;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">{244}</a></span>
but Mrs. Romayne interposed, lifting her
hand peremptorily without even glancing at
him.</p>

<p>“I know everything,” she said. “I know
that you are in hideous danger, and if you
run away from it it is indeed all over
with you. You must face it; you must defy
it!”</p>

<p>As though in her last words she had
touched and given form and life to the very
core of the determination which had nerved
her since she had first read Julian’s letter that
morning, her voice rose as she spoke them
into a ring of indomitable courage, vibrating
with the very triumph of that defiance of
which she spoke. Her slight, haggard physique
seemed to expand, to gain in dignity
and power; as the whole room seemed to fill
with the magnetism of her intense resolution.
There was an instant’s pause, and then an
exclamation broke alike from Julian and from
Falconer. Julian’s was almost derisive in its
absolute repudiation of her words; Falconer’s
was sternly incredulous. Clemence was
standing a little apart. No sound came from
her, but she lifted her face suddenly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">{245}</a></span>
turned it towards Mrs. Romayne. A vague
horror and confusion had dawned in her
eyes.</p>

<p>Before the annihilating words with which
Falconer obviously intended to follow up his
first ejaculation could be uttered, Mrs. Romayne
was speaking again&mdash;in a rapid,
businesslike tone now, but always with that
ring of triumph behind it.</p>

<p>“You must come back with me to-night
and take up your position as if nothing could
shake it. You must fight for your credit and
your social status tooth and nail. When you
have lost them you have lost everything!
You have not lost them yet, and no risk is too
great to run for their retention.”</p>

<p>“Not penal servitude?” asked Julian,
with a ghastly smile.</p>

<p>“Not penal servitude, not hanging&mdash;if
that were the risk,” returned his mother
passionately. “What are you better off if
you escape&mdash;disgraced, ostracised, ruined beyond
all hope of reclamation&mdash;than you
would be in a convict’s cell? What would
you have to live for&mdash;to hope for? When
you have lost your position with the world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">{246}</a></span>
you have lost everything. What does it
matter that you go down in one wave rather
than another?” She paused a moment,
battling with her fierce horror and repulsion.
Then she went on again in another tone,
eager and decided. “But the risk is not so
frightful after all,” she said. “Show it a bold
front and we shall triumph over it! Now,
listen to me, Julian. This other man&mdash;this
man Ramsay&mdash;was the actual forger?”</p>

<p>She paused for an answer, and apparently
the insistence of her tone forced one from
Julian in spite of himself.</p>

<p>“As far as the actual commission of
the forgery goes&mdash;yes,” he said sullenly.
“But&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Then what is there to prove&mdash;to prove,
mind&mdash;that you were a party to it?”</p>

<p>Julian glanced round at Clemence as if
involuntarily. Then he looked recklessly
back at his mother and laughed harshly.</p>

<p>“The facts&mdash;&mdash;” he began.</p>

<p>His mother caught up the words.</p>

<p>“The facts? Yes!” she said. “But if
the facts are denied? Can they be proved?
If you face this meeting and say that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">{247}</a></span>
yourself have been deceived? Even if it
should come to a prosecution there are always
loopholes! With good counsel and facing it
out ourselves unflinchingly, you would come
through untouched! It is the only chance,
Julian, and we must dare it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">{248}</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> red glow from the setting sun had
shifted a little. It fell now behind Julian
and between him and Clemence, and its
light seemed to isolate the mother and son,
shutting them in alone together. Mrs.
Romayne stood a few paces from Julian,
not touching him or appealing to him,
concentrating all her forces on the dominating
of his weaker nature. Julian stood
doggedly before her, his hands clenched, his
face set. Near the window, looking across
the shabby little room from which those
two figures, eloquent of struggle and crisis,
stood out so strangely, was Clemence; her
eyes fixed upon Julian now as though life
and death hung on his looks. Aloof alike
from Clemence and from the mother and
son, a grim spectator holding in reserve his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">{249}</a></span>
weight of condemnation until the upshot
of the scene should declare itself, was Dennis
Falconer.</p>

<p>For all answer, as though her ringing
words had touched him so little that he
found them not even worth the trouble of
an articulate denial, Julian shook his head
sullenly. The gesture witnessed to a heavy
dead weight of dissent likely to be more
difficult to act upon than the most vehement
opposition, and Mrs. Romayne paused for a
moment, looking at him, her lips taking a
firmer line, her eyes flashing.</p>

<p>“You don’t realise the position,” she
said. “Look at it and understand the
choice before you. On the one hand is
ignominy, ruin, the end of your career; to
reach it you have only to give way to your
nerves, to act under the influence of panic,
to run away, in short. On the other hand,”
she moved a step nearer to him with a tense,
emphatic gesture, which seemed an outlet
for some of the passionate urgency which
she was keeping resolutely in hand; “on
the other hand is the very reverse of all
this. Social position, consideration, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">{250}</a></span>
prosperous life to which you have always
looked forward&mdash;all this is to be retained
by one bold stroke, by a little courage and
resolution, and at the risk of what is by
no means worse than the life which must
inevitably be yours if you do not nerve
yourself to run it. Julian, think what is at
stake!”</p>

<p>Falconer’s eyes had been fixed on Mrs.
Romayne, severe, inexorable in their condemnation.
They travelled, now, to Julian.</p>

<p>Again Julian made that dull gesture of
negation.</p>

<p>“It’s all over,” he said doggedly. “I’ve
staked and lost.”</p>

<p>“You have not lost&mdash;yet,” his mother
cried; the vibration in her voice was stronger
now, and there were white patches coming
and going faintly about her mouth. “You
shall not lose while I can lift a hand to
save you. Think!&mdash;think! It’s all before
you still&mdash;happiness, success, life! You’ve
only to grasp them instead of letting go.
Think!”</p>

<p>Julian had been standing with his haggard
young face averted from her, staring sullenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">{251}</a></span>
at the ground. He turned upon her suddenly,
his face quivering with an impotent misery
of regret, his voice ringing with hopeless
bitterness.</p>

<p>“They’re gone,” he said. “I’ve thrown
them all away. I might as well be dead,
that’s true enough. It might be possible
to brazen it out&mdash;I don’t know, I don’t
care! It wouldn’t give me anything worth
having. Social position, credit, standing!
What good would they be to me? I’m sick
of the whole thing! I’ve done with it!”</p>

<p>His incoherent, hardly articulated words
stopped abruptly, and he seemed to struggle
fiercely for means of expression; so fiercely
that the blind, impotent wrestle with the
limitations of a lifetime seemed to dominate
the situation for the moment, and in Mrs.
Romayne’s agonised face, as she watched
him, the life seemed arrested. It was as
though he were groping and fighting among
sensations and instincts so new to him that
he had no words in his vocabulary in which
to clothe them; and the effort to express
them was instinct with the despair of conscious
futility. He seemed to break away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">{252}</a></span>
at last and rush upon a wild, confused
declaration which comprised all that he
could grasp.</p>

<p>“Why should I fight for what I don’t
want?” he cried hoarsely. “There’s nothing
worth having now.”</p>

<p>“My boy!” The cry arrested Clemence,
moving towards Julian with shining eyes
and white, parted lips. It arrested Falconer,
who had drawn nearer to Mrs. Romayne,
with a desperate impulse to end the struggle
by throwing into the scale, against Mrs.
Romayne, the weight of his opinion. “My
boy, my boy! don’t talk like that, for
Heaven’s sake! For Heaven’s sake! Julian,
my darling, if not for yourself, for your
mother! I have lived for you. I have
had no thought in life but you&mdash;to save
you, to protect you, to keep you from ruin
such as this! Don’t break my heart. Ah!”
she broke into a low, wailing moan, wringing
her hands together as her eyes fastened on
his face, transfixed into an expression of
blank surprise as his eyes met hers for the
first time. “Don’t look like that! Julian,
Julian! In all these years have you never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">{253}</a></span>
understood? Have you never understood
how I have loved you?”</p>

<p>They were face to face, mother and son,
all the artificialities and conventionalities of
their lives scorched and burnt away. But
between them lay that unbridgeable gulf of
ignorance and wrong, and her outstretched
hands appealed to him in vain. He looked
at her coldly, uncertainly, as though she
were a stranger to him.</p>

<p>Then, with one strange, gasping cry,
she seemed to thrust all consciousness of
herself fiercely on one side in her realisation
of his great need. In the very crisis of
her agony, in the very crisis as it seemed
of her defeat, there came upon her a great
dignity.</p>

<p>“My son,” she said, “there is something
in your life of which you have never known&mdash;something
which accident might have revealed
to you at any time, but which I
kept from you, hoping that fortune might
favour me&mdash;as it has done&mdash;and preserve
your ignorance; believing that in happiness
and self-respect lay one of your safeguards,
and dreading that knowledge might bring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">{254}</a></span>
to you some sort of morbid temptation.
Julian, it is the toil and struggle of twenty
years that you are trampling on in throwing
down your life like this. Twenty years ago
your father died by his own hand&mdash;a swindler,
liar, and thief. A few chance words brought
home to me the possibility that some such
dreadful taint might rest on you. To keep
you from its awful consequence; to give you
such a life as should obviate the possibility
of temptation; to hedge you in with every
security that money and position could create
for you; to give you such a standing in
the world as should leave you nothing to
wish for; has been the one thought, the
one motive of my life from that time until
now.”</p>

<p>The speech&mdash;so terrible a declaration of
a struggle foredoomed by its own essence
to failure, a struggle in which the foe was
real, the combatant in desperate earnest,
and the weapons straws&mdash;trembled into an
abrupt, palpitating silence, as though her
feelings were too intense for speech. There
was a moment’s stillness like the stillness
of death; a stillness broken only by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">{255}</a></span>
Julian’s long, laboured breaths as he stood
facing her, his face blanched and frozen
into an image of horror. Then he spoke.</p>

<p>“Is it true?” He had turned mechanically
to Dennis Falconer, and the words
came from him in a hoarse whisper.</p>

<p>Dennis Falconer was white to the lips.
Far down in his nature, at the root of the
rigid and conventional morality by which
he lived, was a pulse which palpitated in
harmony with the divine realities of life.
And, as like answers to like, that pulse
in him had recognised its counterpart at
last, through all the cramped distortion
that had concealed it for so long, beating
full and strong, instinct with the throbbing
life of the same great realities, in a dwarfed
and darkened woman’s soul. Perfect mother
love, absolute self-abnegation, let them clothe
themselves in what mistaken form they may,
are an earnest of ideal love and beauty, and
in their presence condemnation must give
place to reverence. Conscious, for the first
time in his life, that he stood in the
midst of that which was beyond his power
to analyse or to estimate, he made no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">{256}</a></span>
attempt at speech. He bowed his head in
silence.</p>

<p>Julian looked at him for a moment
longer, and then he turned his face once
more upon his mother. As though what she
saw there struck into her very heart, a cry
of pity and tenderness broke from her. She
moved swiftly to him, putting her arms
about him, trying to draw him into her
embrace as though he had been once more
her little child.</p>

<p>“Julian!” she cried, “my boy! my boy!
Try to understand&mdash;try to understand why
I have told you this now! I don’t ask you
to think of me&mdash;to think what such a repetition
of the past as threatens me in you would
be to me&mdash;a blow infinitely heavier, an agony
infinitely crueller than what came upon me
twenty years ago, because of the long struggle
to which it would bring defeat, because of
the long hope and resolution which it would
take out of my heart, because of my love
for you, my darling&mdash;my darling!” She was
kissing his hands now passionately, with that
oblivion of any other presence in the room
which she had evinced throughout; and Falconer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">{257}</a></span>
watching her, fascinated, almost awestruck,
saw her, as she went on, lift one of
the young man’s hands and press it to her
cheek, stroking it with a wild, nervous movement
of her own thin fingers.</p>

<p>“But there’s a motive power for you in it,
Julian! A lever for your own pride, your own
strength of will. You are panic-stricken,
unnerved, worn out. Danger is new to
you, my darling! Look at your father’s
fate&mdash;wholesale ruin, disgrace, and obloquy&mdash;and
let it nerve you to turn away from
it. Look down the precipice on the brink
of which you are standing, and lay firm hold
upon the only rope that can save you.
Take your courage in both hands, and we
will face the danger and conquer together.
Oh, my boy, if it is a hot fire to pass through
it won’t last long! It leads to safety, to firmer
standing-ground, to a new lease of life!”</p>

<p>She was clinging to him convulsively,
touching his hands, his hair, his face, as
though speech alone afforded an all-insufficient
outlet for her agonised beseeching.
And as she spoke the last words he seized
her hands in his and thrust her from him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">{258}</a></span>
not with any personal roughness, but rather
unconsciously and involuntarily as in the very
isolation of despair.</p>

<p>“Life!” he cried. “What can life give
to me beyond what I’ve got already? I’ve
got my billet! Like father like son! I’m
bound for the dogs sooner or later, and I don’t
care to spin out the journey. Who’s going to
fight against his fate?”</p>

<p>“It is not fate.”</p>

<p>Through that little room, across and above
the passion and despair that filled it, the
words rang out strong and clear, and Julian
turned with a convulsive start to meet them.</p>

<p>Clemence had come swiftly across the
room and was standing beside him, facing him
as he turned to her; facing Falconer, arrested
in a quick movement to interpose, blindly and
instinctively as it seemed, between Julian and
his mother; facing Mrs. Romayne, as she
stood leaning heavily on the back of a chair,
her eyes strained and terrible to see, her face
ghastly. All that humanity can touch of the
beautiful and the inspiring; all the burning
faith; the quivering personal realisation of
that unseen of which each man is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">{259}</a></span>
part; the human love acting upon and
reacted on by the divine instinct; was shining
out from Clemence’s face. She paused hardly
for an instant as her clear eyes, dark and deep
with the intensity of her fervour, rested on
Julian, as though they saw him and him only
in all the world. Then her voice rang out
again, sweet and full.</p>

<p>“There’s no such thing as fate,” she said.
“Not like that! Not fate that makes us bad.
There’s God, Julian! It’s trying to do right
that matters; nothing else in life; and that
we can all do. There’s nothing, nothing can
prevent us! Oh, I don’t say”&mdash;her voice
broke into a great pity and tenderness&mdash;“I
don’t say that it’s not harder for some than
for others. But it’s what’s hard that is best
worth doing! Julian!”&mdash;she drew a step
nearer to him, stretching out both her hands&mdash;“you’re
looking at it wrong, dear! The
things you’ve lost for good are not the things
that matter. What one has, what people think
of one&mdash;that’s nothing. It’s what one is, it’s
oneself that’s the only thing to mind about.”</p>

<p>She stopped, her whole face stirred and
tremulous with her conviction, and Julian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">{260}</a></span>
with an impulsive movement, caught her
hands in his, and pressed his forehead down
upon them in a blind agony of self-abasement.</p>

<p>“I’m a swindler, Clemmie!” he cried
thickly. It was as though he had hardly
taken in the full sense of her words, but
was clinging to her, and confessing to her
under some blunted, bewildered impetus. “A
cheat and a thief all round! That’s what
I am!”</p>

<p>“But that’s not for ever!” she cried,
such love, and hope, and courage shining in
her eyes as would not let her great tears fall.
“You can retrieve the past! You can repent
and begin again. Ah, I know, of course, that
what is done can’t ever be undone! What
you have done remains the same for always!
But you can change! You can be different,
and nothing else but you yourself matters at
all! What does it matter if people think you
a cheat if you are an honest man? Nothing!
No more than it matters to yourself if they
call you an honest man for ever, when you’re a
cheat!” She paused again, but this time he
did not speak; he lifted his head and drew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">{261}</a></span>
her to him, crushing her hands against his
breast, and looking into her eyes with a
strange, agonised struggle towards comprehension
dawning in his own.</p>

<p>There was a moment’s dead silence. There
was that passing between Clemence and
Julian which no words could have touched&mdash;the
final struggle towards dominion of a man’s
better nature. Falconer had fallen back.
All that was narrow and conventional about
his morality had shrivelled into nothingness,
and stood confessed to his own consciousness
for what it was. He knew that the great
question now at issue was beyond the reach of
his man’s practicality, and that he could only
stand aside.</p>

<p>Mrs. Romayne was gripping heavily at the
chair by which she stood; impotent, frozen
despair paralysing her from head to foot,
leaving alive and sentient only her eyes.</p>

<p>“You must go back, dear.” The words
fell from Clemence’s lips tender, distinct, immutable
as the laws of right and wrong.
“You must take the consequences of what
you’ve done, and through that pain and shame
you’ll get above it to begin again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">{262}</a></span></p>

<p>Julian’s lips, white now as ashes, moved
stiffly.</p>

<p>“The consequences?” he whispered. “The
consequences, Clemmie?”</p>

<p>“The consequences,” she replied, and in
the ring of her voice, in the clasp with which
her hands closed over his, was all the courage
and conviction with which she sought to
nerve him. “Ah, I don’t know&mdash;I don’t
understand&mdash;but are there no innocent people
who may suffer for your fault unless you are
there to take it on yourself? Besides, how
else, dear? How can you begin again without
having made amends? How can you free
yourself of the past without acknowledging
what’s black and bad in it? And if you
acknowledge what’s black and bad, how can
you hesitate to take its punishment?”</p>

<p>And as if that struggling life in him were
growing and stirring under her influence,
a strange flickering light crept into Julian’s
face and the struggle in his eyes grew
into a faint suggestion of victory. He
paused a moment, his breath coming thick
and fast.</p>

<p>“But suppose&mdash;suppose it isn’t any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">{263}</a></span>
good?” His voice, tense, hardly audible,
seemed to catch and strain like that of a
man at the very crisis of his life. “Suppose
it’s in me and I must&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It isn’t so!” she cried, and as she spoke
she drew away from him as though carried
beyond herself, beyond her womanly love
for him, in that supreme declaration of the
truth that was her very being. “You know
it isn’t so! There is no ‘must’ except God’s
‘must’ to us that we should follow Him.
There is no power can tear us from His hand
unless we throw ourselves away by saying
that His hand is without strength to save
us. Good and evil lie before every one of
us, and we must all choose. And nothing
else is real and living in this life except
that choice and the end to which it leads
us!”</p>

<p>Through all the limitations of the
phraseology in which her faith was clothed,
the great truth which makes the mystery of
humanity, the truth which words can only
belittle and obscure, which lives not in words
but in the silent consciousness of each man’s
soul, rang out, all-penetrating and all-dominating.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">{264}</a></span>
And as she faced him, her eyes
shining, her whole face radiant, Julian caught
her in his arms with a great cry.</p>

<p>“I will,” he cried. “Clemence, I choose.
Help me! I will go back.”</p>

<p>She yielded to his touch, with a low sob,
and as they stood clasped in one another’s
arms, a shuddering moan rang through the
room, and Mrs. Romayne fell heavily forward
at their feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">{265}</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">“Will</span> she suffer any more?”</p>

<p>On the upper landing of the hotel in
which Falconer had found Julian, Clemence
was standing, one hand resting on the
handle of a door which she had just closed
behind her, looking in the uncertain light
of a flickering gas-jet into the face of the
man to whom she spoke. He was a quick,
capable-looking man, with a brisk, professional
manner, evidently a doctor. Clemence’s face
was pale and tired, as though with strain
or watching, and her low voice shook a
little. The doctor was drawing on his left-hand
glove, and he paused to answer her.</p>

<p>“I should say that she would not,” he
said. “It is practically over.” He gave a
keen, rather curious look at Clemence and then
added: “You are alone with the lady?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">{266}</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” said Clemence simply.</p>

<p>A long night and a long day had
passed, and between Mrs. Romayne and
the one absorbing passion of her life had
fallen that solemn shadow before which all
earthly passions pale and fade away; that
solemn shadow before whose creeping touch
not strength of will, not love itself, can
stand. As she fell to the ground before
her son she had loosed her hold perforce
on all the struggle and burning resolution
which was life to her; she had followed
the guide whom none may resist into
that valley through which every one must
pass, and its mists had lifted from her
no more. From that one long faint she
had been brought back only to fall into
another; in such total unconsciousness, which
had yielded twice to intervals of physical
pain terrible to see, the long hours had
passed.</p>

<p>And in one of these spaces of blank
unconsciousness Julian Romayne had seen
his mother for the last time. The necessity
for his departure was pressing and relentless.
The meeting of the shareholders was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">{267}</a></span>
imminent, and that meeting he must face.
He had left his mother’s room in the grey
light of the early morning with a look on
his face which Clemence, the only witness
of that mute parting, never forgot; and he
had gone away with Dennis Falconer to
make those preparations for his surrender
of himself to justice which were not to be
delayed.</p>

<p>And now the day was drawing to a close.
The doctor had paid his last visit, and the
night was drawing on.</p>

<p>There was a moment’s pause after
Clemence’s words. Then the doctor wished
her a professional good-night, and, as he went
downstairs, she turned and went back into the
room.</p>

<p>It was a small room, the best which the
hotel cared to place at the disposal of sudden
illness, but somewhat dingy and ill-appointed.
The gaslight, shaded from the face upon the
bed, but shedding a garish light upon the rest
of the room, touched nothing luxurious, nothing
which its present occupant could have
realised in connection with herself. Her very
rings lying upon the dressing-table and flashing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">{268}</a></span>
under the gaslight, seemed to protest
against such poor surroundings.</p>

<p>But the figure on the bed lay motionless,
protesting never more. It lay in blank unconsciousness
even when Clemence, crossing
the room, stood for a moment looking down,
her whole face tender and quivering, and
then sank gently on her knees and pressed
her lips, with a womanly gesture of infinite
pity, to the pale, inanimate hand upon the
bed. It was over now, practically, as the
doctor, looking at that waning life from a
purely physical point of view, had said&mdash;all
the struggle and the dread, all the courage and
the hope, the valiant ignorance of twenty
years. And the face upon the pillow was the
face of the vanquished&mdash;the face of one whose
last vivid consciousness of earthly things had
been the consciousness of failure.</p>

<p>For many minutes Clemence knelt there,
all the feeling of her woman’s soul seeming to
expend itself in that soft, mute pressure.
Then she rose quietly and moved across the
room to make some final preparation for the
night. That done, she came back again to
the bedside, and doing so she started. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">{269}</a></span>
shadowy hands were moving feebly upon the
counterpane. From out the grey, pinched
face upon the pillow two glazed blue eyes
were looking with a restless, searching movement
as though in want of something. They
rested upon Clemence with no recognition in
them; but as her son’s wife drew nearer to
her quickly and gently, Mrs. Romayne moved
feebly and tried to turn her head upon the
pillow, as though moved by some vague, indefinite,
and far-away sense of dislike and
repulsion. Her white lips moved uncertainly
as she did so, and faint sounds came from
between them. Clemence bent over her
tenderly and tried to catch the words; and
they grew gradually a little clearer.</p>

<p>“My boy!” the faint, uncertain voice
muttered, “my little boy!”</p>

<p>A great wave of pity and yearning swept
over Clemence, and she sank once more to her
knees, fixing her eyes on the poor, worn face.
Was it of any use to speak? Could her voice
reach to those dim lands where the mother
groped for her “little boy”?</p>

<p>“He will come!” she said. “He will
come&mdash;by-and-by!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">{270}</a></span></p>

<p>As though the voice had roused her without
penetrating to her brain, Mrs. Romayne
moved again&mdash;that slight, feeble movement so
eloquent of the extremity of weakness. Her
eyes turned to Clemence with that glance of
vague, unrecognising dislike.</p>

<p>“No,” she said, as though answering her&mdash;“no,
he’s too little.” She paused, and again
there was that groping movement of her
hands. “His letter,” she muttered, “his
letter! My dear mamma! my dear mamma!”</p>

<p>There was a restless distress in the glazed
eyes now, and their glance tore Clemence’s
heart. The feeble hands were moving painfully,
and as she watched, with her tears
falling fast in her impotent pity and longing
to satisfy their craving, something in their
movements, all unmeaning as they seemed at
first, penetrated to Clemence’s understanding
with one of those strange flashes of comprehension
only possible under so tense a strain
of sympathy. Those nerveless hands were
feeling for a pocket! In an instant Clemence
had risen, crossed the room, and put her hand
into the pocket of the dress which Mrs.
Romayne had worn. Her finger touched a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">{271}</a></span>
paper, and she drew it out instantly. She
saw that it was yellow and faded with age, and
she moved quickly back with it to the bedside.
The hands and the eyes were still moving,
but the muttered words were audible no longer,
and as Clemence put the paper gently between
the thin fingers, she felt with a sudden thrill
of awe that they were growing cold.</p>

<p>But the touch seemed to rouse Mrs.
Romayne once more. Her fingers closed on
the paper as if instinctively, and the restless
distress died out of her eyes as she tried&mdash;vainly&mdash;to
unfold the paper. Clemence put out her
hand gently, and did the work for which the
dying fingers had no strength, and on the
dying face there dawned a pale, shadowy
smile.</p>

<p>“Yes!” she said. “Yes! ‘My dear
mamma!’ My dear mamma! Your loving&mdash;son&mdash;Julian!”</p>

<p>And with her son’s name on her lips,
Mrs. Romayne left him behind, and passed
from ignorance to knowledge.</p>

<p class="tb">The trial and conviction of Julian
Romayne were a nine days’ wonder in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">{272}</a></span>
society. The people who had most readily
and carelessly received the widow and son
of William Romayne, asked one another
with the martyred air of those whose
charity has been abused and their feelings
for morality outraged, what was to be
expected after all of the son of such a
father? The people whose feelings for
morality had been outraged at the outset
by Mrs. Romayne’s reappearance in London,
and soothed subsequently by the simplicity
of the position, observed sagely that they
had always said so. Both parties were
unanimous in the assertion that the young
man’s life was practically at an end. He
had forfeited his place in society for ever.</p>

<p>But Julian himself realised gradually and
painfully during the years of his punishment;
with the strength of a manhood attained
through pain, when he went away to a new
country with his wife and child; that his
life had just begun.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
